Download and execute the package file {win32} (Windows 7 or later,
32-bit) or {win64} (Windows 7 or later, 64-bit) following these
instructions:

* Install _WSJT-X_ into its own directory, for example
`C:\WSJTX` or `C:\WSJT\WSJTX`, rather than the conventional location
`C:\Program Files ...\WSJTX`.  Do not use a directory path that
includes an embedded blank.

* All program files relating to _WSJT-X_ are stored in the chosen
  installation directory and its subdirectories.

* Logs and other writeable files are normally found in the
  directory +

`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\WSJT-X`.

TIP: Your computer may be configured so that this directory is
     "`invisible`".  It's there, however, and accessible.  An
     alternative (shortcut) directory name is
     `"%LocalAppData%\WSJT-X\"`.

* The built-in Windows facility for time synchronization is usually
  not adequate.  We recommend the program _Meinberg NTP Client_: see
  {ntpsetup} for downloading and installation instructions. Recent
  versions of Windows 10 are now shipped with a more capable Internet
  time synchronization service that is suitable if configured
  appropriately. We do not recommend SNTP time setting tools or others
  that make periodic correction steps, _WSJT-X_ requires that the PC
  clock be monotonically increasing and smoothly continuous.

NOTE: Having a PC clock that appears to be synchronized to UTC is not
      sufficient.  "`Monotonically increasing`" means that the clock
      must not be stepped backwards. "`Smoothly continuous`" means
      that time must increase at a nearly constant rate, without
      steps.  Any necessary clock corrections must be applied by
      adjusting the rate of increase, thereby correcting
      synchronization errors gradually.

* _WSJT-X_ requires installation of the _OpenSSL_ libraries. Suitable
  libraries may already be installed on your system. If they are not,
  you will see this error shortly after requesting a fetch of the
  latest LoTW users database. To fix this, install the _OpenSSL_
  libraries.

** You can download a suitable _OpenSSL_ package for Windows from
   {win_openssl_packages}; you need the latest *Windows Light*
   version. For the 32-bit _WSJT-X_ build, use the latest Win32 v1.1.1
   version of the _OpenSSL_ libraries, for the 64-bit _WSJT-X_ use the
   latest Win64 v1.1.1 version of the _OpenSSL_ libraries (Note: it is
   OK to install both versions on a 64-bit system) which, at the time
   of writing, were {win32_openssl} and {win64_openssl} respectively.

** Install the package and accept the default options, including the
   option to copy the _OpenSSL_ DLLs to the Windows system
   directory. There is no obligation to donate to the _OpenSSL_
   project. Un-check all the donation options if desired. +

NOTE: If you still get the same network error after installing the
      _OpenSSL_ libraries then you also need to install the
      {msvcpp_redist} component. From the download page select
      `vcredist_x86.exe` for use with the 32-bit _WSJT-X_ build or
      `vcredist_x64.exe` with the 64-bit build, then run it to
      install.

TIP: If you cannot install the _OpenSSL_ libraries or do not have an
     Internet connection on the computer used to run
     _WSJT-X_ {VERSION_MAJOR}.{VERSION_MINOR}, you can download
     the _LoTW_ file manually. Go to
     https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-user-activity.csv in a web browser,
     download the file, then move it to the _WSJT-X_ log files
     directory. This directory can be opened by selecting
     *File|Open log directory* from the main menu.

* _WSJT-X_ expects your sound card to do its raw sampling at 48000 Hz.
  To ensure that this will be so when running under recent versions of
  Windows, open the system's *Sound* control panel and select in turn
  the *Recording* and *Playback* tabs. Click *Properties*, then
  *Advanced*, and select *16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality)*. Switch off
  all audio enhancement features for these devices.

* You can uninstall _WSJT-X_ by clicking its *Uninstall* link in the
  Windows *Start* menu, or by using *Uninstall a Program* on the
  *Windows Control Panel|Programs and Features* option or in *Settings|Apps* on Windows 10.
