                      Release: WSJT-X 2.7.0-rc4
                           March 11, 2024
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.7.0 Release Candidate 4 brings some improvements for Fox-mode
operators, new features for companion program QMAP, and a number of
relatively minor enhancements and bug fixes.

QMAP enhancements -- of particular interest to EME operators:

 - QMAP now decodes Q65 submodes with both 60-second and 30-second T/R
   sequence lengths. Clicking on a resulting line in the WSJT-X Active
   Stations window automatically sets dial frequency and working
   submode as needed to call that station.

 - QMAP operates in 60-second receive sequences, and its Q65 decoder
   starts at t=19.5, 30.0, 49.5, and 58.5 s into the sequence.  Most
   decoded messages are displayed well before the end of the relevant
   time slot.

 - A new, more compact file format is now used for wideband data
   files.  A "Save decoded" option has been added to the Save menu.

 - An option has been added to allow exporting a 3 kHz portion of a
   wideband data file as a standard WSJT-X *.wav file.

 - CTRL+click on QMAP's upper waterfall sends an integer kHz dial
   frequency request to WSJT-X.

 - With focus on the WSJT-X main window, hit Alt+A on the keyboard to
   clear the Active Stations window.

 - Many minor enhancements to the User Interface.

WSJT-X:

 - Enable decoding of MSK144 from the jt9[.exe] executable.

 - Several changes to reduce problems experienced when (contrary to
   our recommendations) messages with short (10-bit) callsign hashes
   are used in standard FT4/FT8 sub-bands.

 - Enhancements useful for Fox operators.

                      Release: WSJT-X 2.7.0-rc3
                           January 1, 2024
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.7.0 Release Candidate 3 brings some new features, as well as 
numerous detail improvements and bug fixes, such as:

 - Added a new "Update Hamlib" function. On Windows, it allows the user to 
   update Hamlib directly from the program. The previously used version is 
   backed up, so the user can easily revert a hamlib update. 

 - The Hamlib version in use is now displayed (also on Linux and macOS).

 - The FT Roundup Messages protocol has been enhanced. It now allows also 
   the exchange of static 4-digit numbers instead of serial numbers. This 
   extends the usability of the FT RU protocol for other contest types.

 - Improved direct switching between modes. Submode, as well as the status 
   of the "Sh" and "Fast" checkboxes are now saved and restored by mode.

 - Some right-click events were made more intuitive and consistent. 
   - Right-clicking the Q65 button enables Q65 Pileup mode, a left-click 
     brings you back to the normal Q65 mode.
   - Right-click the JT65 button to switch to JT9 mode.

 - For Q65, all messages for us are now displayed in the right window.

 - Message averaging is now allowed only when VHF features are
   enabled, and label texts are changed to "Single Period Decodes" and
   "Average Decodes" only if averaging is enabled.

 - Some improvements to the Hamlib Transceiver code. Behavior is now
   more stable when Rig Split has been selected.

 - Prevented redundant network communication between WSJT-X and DX Lab 
   Suite Commander.

 - Download of the LotW file now works without OpenSSL libraries.

 - Made the spot counter work for WSPR.

 - Prevented insertion of an individual contest name when in Fox mode.

 - WAE entities are now assigned to the correct DXCC when "Include 
   extra WAE entities" is not selected.

 - Added a utility program 'cablog' which can be used to convert the
   wsjtx.log file to Cabrillo format for the ARRL EME contest.

 - Minor improvements to the Active Stations window.

 - The Rx/Tx frequency for Echo mode has been fixed at 1500 Hz.

 - Some corrections and updates to the INSTALL instructions for Linux.

 - Updated CTY.DAT file.

                      Release: WSJT-X 2.7.0-rc2
                             July 7, 2023
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.7.0 Release Candidate 2 introduces several minor improvements
and bug fixes.

 - CTRL+SHIFT+F11/F12 now changes dial frequency by 1000 Hz instead of
   2000 Hz.

 - Improved spotting to PSK Reporter for upcoming HamSCI Festivals of
   Eclipse Ionospheric Science.

 - Added optional Hungarian translation of the user interface.

 - Fixed a flaw that could produce false decodes in Q65 submodes D and E.

 - Fixed a flaw with the QSO start time. It is now reset when the DX 
   Call changes.

 - Fixed a flaw that prevented contest logging of the ARRL Digi Contest.

 - Right-clicking the Q65 mode button to toggle the Q65 Pileup mode on/off 
   now also works on macOS.

 - Fixed a compilation error on macOS Ventura.

 - WSPR and FST4W band hopping now works again.

 - It is now ensured that "U.S.A." is displayed when using certain 
   cty.dat files.

 - Corrected the problem with duplicated FT8 entries in ActiveStations 
   window.

                      Release: WSJT-X 2.7.0-rc1
                             May 12, 2023
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.7.0 Release Candidate 1 introduces a new program called QMAP,
a new Special Operating Activity known as Q65 Pileup, and a number of
other enhancements and fixes.

 - QMAP and Q65 Pileup mode are of particular interest to those
   engaged in Earth-Moon-Earth (EME) communication, but other
   applications may be found for them as well.

   - QMAP is derived from MAP65, an older program used since 2007 for
     EME, mainly on the 2 m band. QMAP provides single-polarization
     receive-only capabilities for any one of the 60-second submodes
     of Q65. It allows you to monitor all traffic in a 90 kHz subband
     while conducting EME QSOs in the usual way with WSJT-X.

   - Q65 Pileup mode is a new feature in WSJT-X that will assist DX
     operators using Q65 in pileup circumstances with many
     simultaneous callers and very weak signals, such as those
     experienced by 6-meter EME DXpeditions.

   - Further details on QMAP and Q65 Pileup mode are available in a
     Quick-Start guide posted here:
     https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/Quick_Start_WSJT-X_2.7_QMAP.pdf

 - WSJT-X now provides more efficient spotting to PSK Reporter.
   Redundant spots are omitted, and posting of spots is now spread
   more widely in time. (Temporarily, in support of the HamSCI
   Festivals of Eclipse Ionospheric Science, spots will be transmitted
   more frequently during the upcoming solar eclipses.)

 - WSJT-X is now able to process more than 100 FT8 decodes in a single
   reception interval.

 - Improvements to the Fox mode:
   - More convenient and efficient handling of the two queues.
   - Fox Log window now displays statistical data on the QSO rate.

 - When the station locator is changed (e.g during portable
   operations), the new locator will be sent automatically to PSK
   Reporter.

 - The cty.dat file can now be updated by clicking a button on the
   Settings -> Colors tab.

 - A new status display appears when fetching a new LotW file.

 - Multi-streamed messages transmitted by MSHV are now handled
   properly when WSJT-X is in Hound mode.

 - Auto-sequencing now has better protection against unwanted effects
   caused by late FT8 decodes.

 - Fixed an inconsistency in which Contest Name was not correctly
   remembered.

 - Other minor bug fixes.

 - Updated hyperlinks to our homepage and to our new WSJT GROUP User
   Forum (https://groups.io/g/wsjtgroup/) can now also be found in the
   User Guide.

 - The build instructions for macOS have been clarified.


                        Release: WSJT-X 2.6.1
                           January 16, 2023
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.6.1 is mostly a bug fix release for Q65.  It has the following  
changes since release 2.6.0:

 - Fix a flaw in Q65 mode that prevented proper display of the T/R 
   period spinner.

 - Correct the reference to "ARRL International Digital Contest" in the 
   Release Notes.

 - Make the initialization of the decoded text font more robust.

 - Better initialization when starting the program in FT8 Hound mode.

 - Fix a compiler warning on macOS.


                        Release: WSJT-X 2.6.0
                           January 6, 2023
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.6.0 is a General Availability (GA) release, the first since
version 2.5.4.  Its major enhancements include the following:

 - Mode selection buttons on main window for FT4, FT8, JT65, MSK144, 
   Q65, and FT8's Hound mode

 - Improved calibration of SNR estimates for modes FST4 and FST4W

Other enhancements and bug fixes since 2.6.0-rc5 include the following:

 - PSK Reporter spotting is now also possible for frequencies > 4 GHz. 
   This is required for QO-100, for example.

 - The minimum width of the main window has been further reduced, and 
   such small sizes are now remembered and properly restored.

 - Some further improvements for Fox operators.

 - Fix the long-standing flaw that "Start new period decodes at top" 
   didn't work anymore after several hours.

 - Fix a flaw that could cause crashes by double-clicking messages 
   with <...> in certain QSO situations.

 - Fix a flaw that prevented the rig from initializing correctly after 
   switching between configurations when connected via HRD.

 - Add tooltips to better explain the split operation options.

following.


                      Release: WSJT-X 2.6.0-rc5
                          November 29, 2022
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.6.0 Release Candidate 5 brings a number of improvements as
well as some bug fixes.

In program WSJT-X:

 - Better calibration for FST4/W SNR estimates.

 - Upload FST4W-900 spots to wsprnet with TR code 15 instead of 16.

 - Improved FT8 decoding on crowded bands. 

 - The Working frequency table now offers the following options:
   - Better handling of more than one frequency per band.
   - Set your preferred frequencies, WSJT-X always comes back to these
     QRGs when changing band or mode.
   - You can label your frequencies with descriptions (e.g. DXp AB0YXZ).
   - Option to set Start and End Date/Time, so that the frequencies 
     automatically appear and disappear. Useful for contest or 
     DXpedition QRGs.
   - Load a frequency table from a file to easily get all such data 
     implemented.

 - In Fox mode, there are now a few additional functions that allow 
   operators to react even better to different QSO situations:
   - A new two-column table in Tab 2 provides a better overview of 
     the queue and of the callsigns with QSOs in progress.
   - Fox operator can now change the ordering of callsigns in the
     queue so that he can react if there is only a narrow time slot
     for a particular QSO due to propagation.
   - Fox now responds for another two cycles to stations whose 
     report was not received, increasing the success rate for a
     difficult QSO.

 - Correct a flaw in Hound mode that sometimes prevented completion of
   QSOs with non-standard calls.

 - Improvements to EME Echo mode:
   - New control "Avg" sets the number of Echo cycles to be averaged.
   - New capability to display measurements of wideband noise power as
     a function of time.  This can be useful for measuring Sun noise,
     antenna tracking errors, and the like.
   - Several minor bug fixes

 - Correct a flaw that prevented WSJT-X from always initializing 
   correctly when special operating activities were enabled.

 - Correct a flaw that caused wrong Tx frequencies to be written to  
   ALL.TXT.

 - The GUI has been improved regarding some details. The controls now 
   scale better at different font sizes and on different operating 
   systems.

 - When in Hound mode and click the "H" button again, the frequency 
   is now kept. This gives the user the following two options to return 
   to normal FT8 mode:
    - Click the "H" button again. Then you will stay on the QRG.
    - Click the "FT8" button (or use the Settings menu). It brings  
      you back to the default FT8 QRG.

 - Decodes flagged as 'a7' are now disabled when "Enable AP" is not
   checked, and during the first period after a band change.

 - The network address of the UDP server is now checked for errors  
   before being accepted.

 - Some improvements to the DX Lab Suite Commander interface. 

 - Correct some possible flaws that could cause segfault errors in 
   certain unusual situations.

 - Warnings on dropped audio have been disabled for now, as detection  
   has turned out to be not reliable enough.

 - Correct a long-standing flaw which caused the "Transmit digital gain" 
   overlay to appear somewhere on the screen.

 - "Highlight DX Call" now also works when the other station is <...>.

 - CQ messages without a grid are now sent to PSK reporter.

 - Several other minor corrections (tool tips, etc.). 

Program MAP65 (Windows only) includes several minor bug fixes and two 
tentative new features:
 - an aid for measuring antenna pointing errors
 - an ability to read the file wsjtx.log (kept by WSJT-X) to recognize
   EME contest dupes.


                      Release: WSJT-X 2.6.0-rc4
                          September 8, 2022
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.6.0 Release Candidate 4 provides further improvements to Echo 
mode, a new File menu item, and several bug fixes.

 - New features and fixes for Echo mode
   - Created a new simulator echosim[.exe]
   - Improved organization of output to text window
   - Gain and Zero controls in Echo Graph now behave independently
   - "Clear Avg" now erases the plot in Echo Graph
   - Optional baseline for plots in Echo Graph

 - New menu item "File | Copy main text window to WSJT-X.txt"
 - Doppler tracking checkbox is made sticky

 - Fix an RC2 bug that prevented normal use of JT9.
 - Fix a rarely experienced failure when writing to decoded.txt

 - Rig control interface to Ham Radio deluxe made more robust 


	        Release: WSJT-X 2.6.0-rc3
	             August 22, 2022
	        ----------------------

WSJT-X 2.6.0 Release Candidate 3 provides improvements to Echo mode and
several bug fixes.

 - Echo mode now allows audio-frequency corrections rather than
   CAT-controlled resetting of dial frequency for Doppler corrections,
   when Doppler shift is less than 750 Hz.  Audio-frequency
   corrections are also used to correct any remaining portion of
   Doppler shift caused by coarse CAT-controlled frequency setting.

 - Echo mode now saves .wav files when "Save all" is selected.  When
   such files are opened in Echo mode, the astronomical parameters at
   recording time are restored and used for processing the Echo data.

 - A missing Leap Second (January 1, 2017) was added to the code that
   converts UTC to UT1.  This detail might matter if you want full
   accuracy EME Doppler corrections.

 - EME Doppler values are now rounded to nearest integer Hz.

 - For backward compatibility, "Special Operating Activity"
   enumerations for Fox and Hound modes are reset to their previous
   values 6 and 7.

 - Allow FST4W transmissions on 30m band.  Ensure that correct
   frequency is reported to WSPRnet for FST4W decodes with Rx Freq
   spinbox not set to 1500.

 - Fix a bug that could truncate WSPR transmissions early.

 - Fix a bug that occasionally caused a crash when 'decoded.txt'
   could not be opened.

 - Fix a bug that could cause a crash if Astronomical Data window
   is not active when needed.

 - Fix a bug that caused a crash when "Reset Cabrillo Log" is
   selected with Active Stations window not active.


	        Release: WSJT-X 2.6.0-rc2
	             July 21, 2022
	        ----------------------

WSJT-X 2.6.0 Release Candidate 2 brings a number of improvements as
well as some bug fixes.

 - The "Measure" function in Echo mode now uses the computed Doppler
   spread for DX grid, when available.  This feature is especially
   helpful for microwave EME tests, enabling accurate measurement of
   SNR for a DX station.

 - Settings for T/R period and Submode are now remembered by mode when
   you switch directly between (for example) MSK144-15, Q65-60A,
   JT65C, or FST4-120.

 - Tx and Rx audio frequencies are remembered and restored when you
   return from a mode that sets a default frequency of 1500 Hz
   (MSK144, FST4W, Echo, WSPR, FreqCal) and then switching back to
   FT4, FT8, Q65, JT65, or FST4.

 - QSOs in the Contest Log can now be displayed in increasing or
   decreasing order of logged time.  By default the log is scrolled to
   the latest logged QSO, ready for insertion of a new contact.  The
   total number of QSOs in the Contest Log is displayed at bottom left
   of its window.

 - Default FT8 frequency for 4m band (Region 1) is set to 70.154 MHz.

 - Layout of mode buttons has been optimized for 4K screens.

 - Display of Keyboard Shortcuts has been updated.

 - The OK button now has default focus in the LogQSO dialog window.
   You may just hit Enter to log the QSO.

-  Bug fix: The Tx Freq spinbox remained red when coming back from
   some Q65 submodes.  Corrected.

 - Hamlib bug fixes: make sure that VFOB is selected when required on
   some rigs (e.g. IC7610, IC7100), and others.

	        Release: WSJT-X 2.5.4
	             Dec 28, 2021
	        ----------------------

This is mostly a bug fix  release.  It has the following changes since
release 2.5.3:

WSJTX:
 - Repair a defect that caused occasional crashes when in QSO with 
   stations using nonstandard callsigns.

MAP65:
 - Allowing MAP65 "Best-fit Delta phi" solution to be displayed to the

	        Release: WSJT-X 2.5.3
	             Dec 7, 2021
	        ----------------------

This release has the following changes since release 2.5.2:

 - Add a note in memory of G4WJS to the About window

 - Add a simple $DXCALL macro capability for Tx messages, and update
   the User Guide accordingly

 - Ensure that MAIN VFO is used for receiving on rigs that require it
 
 - Repair a defect in reporting low-confidence decodes to PskReporter

 - Updated CTY.DAT database, tnx to Jim AD1C


	        Release: WSJT-X 2.5.2
	             Nov 4, 2021
	        ----------------------

This is mostly a bug fix  release.  It has the following changes since
release 2.5.1:

 - Repair a  longstanding regression  that caused signal  reports from
   tail-ended Tx2 messages to be omitted from logged information

 - Parse   "dx-call-1 RR73; dx-call-2 <de-call> +nn"  messages  (i3=0,
   n3=1 DXpedition mode) in regular 77-bit modes

 - Repair a regression  associated with setting the  main window width
   on program startup.

 - Repair a problem with Q65 decodes  of type 'q3' for messages of the
   form "<Call_1> Call_2"

 - Execute code associated with Q65 decodes of type 'q5' only when the
   Max   Drift   control   is   set  to   50.    This   fix   prevents
   double-incrementing of  the message averaging counter  on the first
   decoding sequence.

 - Polarization offset 'Dpol' from the astronomical data window is now
   written    to    file     azel.dat    if    environment    variable
   WSJT_AZEL_EXTRA_LINES has  been defined as  1 or greater.   Dpol is
   especially useful for EME on the higher microwave bands.

 - The Auto  Log QSO option  in "Settings->Reporting" now  behaves the
   same  as  the Prompt  to  log  QSO option  when  not  in a  special
   operating context mode.

 - The Fast/Normal/Deep  setting in  Q65 mode is  now a sticky setting
   and is no longer reset to Fast on program startup or  when Settings
   has  been opened. The user selection is used for automatic decodes,
   but Deep is used for any subsequent manual decode attempts.

 - New hamlib code to correct minor flaws in controlling several rigs.

 - Update  the  Chinese  and  Hong   Kong  translations  of  the  user
   interface.

 - Note  that since  the WSJT-X  v2.5.0 GA  release we  have not  been
   providing pre-built 32-bit  packages for Linux on  Intel CPUs, this
   is  due to  the mainstream  Linux Desktop  distributions no  longer
   providing updates for 32-bit only  systems. 32-bit WSJT-X can still
   be  built for  Linux Intel  and is  supported at  least until  some
   prerequisite package is no longer available.

   
	        Release: WSJT-X 2.5.1
	             Oct 21, 2021
	        ----------------------

This release mainly contains improvements and defect repairs related
to Q65 and JT65 modes when used with non-standard and compound
calls. Also included is a new feature for microwave aircraft scatter
and repairs for defects detected since the 2.5.0 GA release.

 - Improved Q65 support for 10GHz Aircraft Scatter contributed by Rex,
   VK7MO, and Roger, W3SZ. (See "10 GHz Terrestrial with Q65" in DUBUS
   Vol 1/2021 page 64.)  Decodes of type 'q3' may now include
   corrections for frequency drift.

 - Repair a defect that failed to pre-load the DE and DX calls to the
   hash lookup tables in the Q65 decoder.

 - Repair standard message Tx4 and Tx5 generation in Q65 mode when
   using a non-standard call.

   Q65-120x and Q65-300x.

 - Audio frequency and decoded message are now saved for up to 100
   most recent Q65 decodes.  Subsequent double-click on waterfall will
   search the list for the clicked frequency +/- 10 Hz, recover
   "DXCall" from the mosr recent decode there, and attempt a decode at
   that frequency with full "q3" sensitivity.

 - Use new ADIF recommendations for Q65: mode=MFSK, submode=Q65.

 - If "Single decode" is unchecked, look for Q65 decodes from
   accumulated average even after obtaining a single-sequence
   decode at selected Rx Freq.

 - For data read from .wav files, display the original UTC (derived
   from file name) on the waterfall instead of current UTC.
   
 - Protect against bounds errors caused by unusual settings on the
   Wide Graph.

 - Correct a problem with Split operation in FT4 mode.  Thanks to

   background when its value should be 700 Hz but is not.

 - Program displays a warning label if a contest mode is active in Q65
   mode.

 - Many updates to User Guide, mostly related to Q65.

 - Repaired a regression that disallowed a new QSO initiation after an
   abandoned QSO.

		   Release: WSJT-X 2.3.1
		        Mar 26, 2021
		   ---------------------

WSJT-X 2.3.1  General Availability release  updates the User  Guide to
cover the  new modes FST4 and  FST4W along with sample  .WAV files and
decoding tutorials. This release also  repairs a number of defects and
regressions  discovered  since  the v2.3.0  release,  including  those
below.

 - When  sending traffic  to a  multicast UDP  server ensure  that the
   local loop-back interface is used if no others are selected.

 - Repair  a defect  in instance  lock  file handling  that causes  an
   infinite loop on start up.

 - Invert the  PTT serial port  sharing default behaviour,  and enable

   port PTT control.

 - Allow  the FST4  and FST4W  decoders  to continue  after the  first
   successful decode when using negative  NB values to try multiple NB
   values.

 - Repair defects in auto-sequencing,  particularly with responding to
   a repeated final message. In general a double-click of the repeated
   message now does the right thing.

 - Repair a regression that had  inadvertently disabled EU VHF Contest
   mode when using the MSK144 mode.

 - Repair a defect  that could caused incorrect log  entry fields when
   using FT4 mode and a priori (AP) decoding.

 - Repair defects saving .WAV files for periods with decodes.

 - Offer a new scheme for adjusting macOS shared memory parameters.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.4.0-rc1
		         Feb 3, 2021
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.4.0 is  a program upgrade offering a new  mode called Q65. It
builds on the capabilities of the QRA64 mode to offer a flexible large
symbol alphabet,  low code  rate, mode with  excellent characteristics
when  used  for EME  on  VHF  through  to  microwave bands,  and  with
challenging weak  signal propagation  via iono-scatter and  similar on
VHF bands. The Q65 mode carries the same 77-bit message payload as the
popular FT8, MSK144, FT4, and FST4  QSO modes. Q65 also offers a range
of T/R periods (15 second through to  5 mins) and tone spacings (up to
32  times  the  base  spacing)   suitable  for  adapting  to  required
sensitivity and  various channel frequency  spreading characteristics.
The Wide Graph plotter  has a super-sensitive synchronization spectrum
capable of detecting  signals below visibility on  the waterfall plot.
The new synchronization plot combined with comprehensive a priori (AP)
decoding techniques and message summing and averaging over multiple Rx
periods  should  make use  near  the  limits  of extreme  weak  signal
operating better than prior modes in all appropriate situations.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.3.0
		         Feb 2, 2021
		   ---------------------

WSJT-X 2.3.0 General Availability release  adds the new modes FST4 and
FST4W along with many defect repairs.  See summaries below and for the
prior release candidates (2.3.0-rc1 through  -rc4) of this version for
details.

 - FST4/W: Disable envelope  shaping at start and  end of transmission
   when environment variable FST4_NOSHAPING=1. Works for fst4sim too.

 - Add time stamp to error message boxes to aid diagnosis.

 - Repair a defect that caused crashes  at start up for some macOS Big
   Sur users.

 - Repair a defect that could cause  the jt9 slow mode decoder process
   to exit incorrectly with a failure status.

 - Updated CTY.DAT file.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.3.0-rc4
		         Jan 26, 2021
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X  2.3.0 Release  Candidate 4  is a  stop-gap release  while some
recent important Hamlib changes are  being verified. Also included are
the following regression and defect repairs.

 - The wsprd command line tool  uses the current working directory for
   the data file directory if it is not specified.

 - Updates to the language translations of the WSJT-X user Interface.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.3.0-rc3
		         Jan 6, 2021
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.3.0  Release Candidate 3  adds an improved FST4W  decoder and
fixes  several defects  and  regressions discovered  since the  second
release candidate.

 - FST4W:  Improve FST4W  decoder sensitivity  on fading  channels and
   decrease false  decode rate.

   FST4W  uses  50-bit   messages  and  a  24-bit   CRC.   The  74-bit
   message+CRC is  encoded into a 240-bit  codeword. Received messages
   are decoded by  two different decoders: (i)  a “belief propagation”
   (BP)  decoder and  (ii) an  ordered statistics  decoder (OSD).  The
   ordered statistics  decoder has a knob  that allows any or  all CRC
   bits to be treated as additional parity bits rather than as part of
   the  message+CRC  field.  Thus,  the OSD  decoder  can  decode  the
   received message  as a  (240,50+Nc) code, where  Nc is  any integer
   between 0  and 24.  In  the RC1 and  RC2 releases the  OSD decoding
   attempt  treated the  code as  a (240,64)  code (14-bit  CRC). This
   release uses 2  OSD decoding attempts that treat  the received word
   as (i) a (240,66) code with 16-bit CRC and code rate 0.308 and (ii)
   a (240,50) code with no CRC and code rate 0.208. Codewords returned
   by  the (240,50)  CRC-less decoding  attempt are  unpacked and  the
   decode is  printed only  if it contains  a callsign/grid  pair that
   have  been previously  decoded  by the  belief propagation  decoder
   (which treats the  code as a (240,74) code with  24-bit CRC) or the
   ordered   statistics  decoder   configured  for   (240,66)  (16-bit
   CRC). The callsign/grid memory  is stored in file “fst4w_calls.txt”
   which resides in the data directory.

 - FT8: Fixed a crash triggered by double clicking on the waterfall to
   invoke a decode of a signal in the preceding T/R interval.

 - FST4W: Do not save .c2 files.

 - FST4W:  Correct a  bug that  could cause  incorrect operation  when
   using  negative noise  blanker (NB)  percentage to  trigger looping
   over a range of NB percentages.

 - fst4sim: Added simulation of Lorentzian fading spectrum, invoked by
   negative fspread values.

 - Color highlighting scheme window fixed in dark mode.

 - Reports sent by QSO partners to  other stations no longer logged in
   error.

 - UDP Status(1) message now includes the current Tx message.

 - Example diagnostic logging configuration files included.

 - Use system localization for date fields in Log QSO dialog.

 - Improvements to audio input and output buffer sizes.

 - wsprd: Fails gracefully if data directory does not exist.

 - wsjtx_app_version: new utility to print application version string.

 - Regression  causing  incorrect  working  frequency  selection  when
   changing modes repaired.

 - Regression with QSO initiation with "Best S&P" repaired.

 - Updated installation instructions for macOS covering M1 hardware.

 - Improved compatibility is Debian 9 required distribution packages.

 - Repair regression with missing time-stamps in the ALL.TXT journal.

 - Allow hamlib_settings.json to work  with PTT only configurations so
   that optional PTT sharing on RTS or DTR can be enabled.

 - Several improvements to main window sizing and layout.

 - Repair regression  with OpenSSL libraries being  required when LoTW
   highlighting is not enabled.

 - Repair a  defect that  caused 2  by 1  callsigns to  be incorrectly
   parsed as non-standard.

 - Several updates to international UI translations.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.3.0-rc2
		         Nov 16, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X  2.3.0  Release Candidate  2  fixes  issues  found in  RC1  and
includes some new functionality that missed the RC1 cut off deadline.

 - Dropped audio samples message box  removed, warnings and errors for
   these are now sent to the WSJT-X system log.

 - FST4W spots to  WSPRNet.org will be augmented such  that the server
   can distinguish the  mode being spotted. Spots  to WSPRNet.org will
   no longer be restricted to WSPR sub-bands.

 - A new  internal system  and data logging  facility used  to provide
   trace,  debug,   information,  warning,  error,  and   fatal  error
   messages. The verbosity and filtering of messages is user definable
   via a configuration file. Without  a configuration file a basic log
   is written with  information, warning and error  messages only. Log
   files are automatically rotated to limit disk usage.

 - Due to  some users using  inappropriate multicast IP  addresses for
   their interoperating  severs the default  behaviour now is  to only
   send multicast  UDP datagrams  to the loop-back  network interface.
   Users who  require WSJT-X UDP  Message Protocol datagrams  to reach
   other  hosts will  now  have  to configure  WSJT-X  to  send on  an
   appropriate  network interface,  and  use  an appropriately  scoped
   multicast group address for their  server applications.  If you are
   not sure then  224.0.0.1 (or ff02::1 if IPv6 is  desired) is a safe
   choice.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.3.0-rc1
		         Sept 28, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X  2.3.0 is  a program  upgrade offering  two new  modes designed
especially for use  on the LF and  MF bands.  FST4 is  for 2-way QSOs,
and FST4W is for WSPR-like transmissions.  Both modes offer a range of
options for T/R sequence  lengths and threshold decoding sensitivities
extending well  into the -40 dB  range.  Early tests have  shown these
modes frequently spanning intercontinental distances on the 2200 m and
630 m bands.  Further details and  operating hints can be found in the
"Quick-Start Guide to FST4 and FST4W", posted on the WSJT web site:

https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/FST4_Quick_Start.pdf

WSJT-X 2.3.0-rc1  is a  beta-quality release  candidate for  a program
upgrade  that provides  a number  of new  features, capabilities,  and
defect repairs.  These include:

 - New modes FST4 and FST4W targeting LF and MF bands.

 - Improved noise baseline discovery for more reliable SNR estimates.

 - On the waterfall and 2D spectrum a tool-tip shows the frequency
   offset under the mouse pointer.

 - The *On Dx Echo* Doppler compensation method has been modified in
   response to feedback from Users. Basic functionality is unchanged.
   See the User Guide (Section 8.1) for more information.

 - Improved user_hardware script or program initiation for WSPR
   band-hopping mode.

 - Decoded  QSO  mode  message   display  narrowed  to  make  appended
   information easier to view without scrolling the window.

 - Option to record the propagation mode in logged QSO records.

 - ADIF v3.1.1 compliance.

 - Option to connect to PSKReporter using TCP/IP for those with very
   poor Internet connections.

 - Major rewrite of the PSKReporter interface to improve efficiency
   and reduce traffic levels.

 - Removal of the Tab 2 generated messages.

 - Accessibility improvements to the UI.

 - Tweaked decode speed options for a better user experience with
   lower powered single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi.

 - Updates to UI translations in Spanish, Italian, Catalan, Chinese,
   Hong Kong Chinese, Danish, and Japanese.

 - Audio devices only enumerated when starting up and opening the
   "Settings->Audio" device lists.

 - Option to select the default audio device removed to minimize the
   likelihood of system sounds being transmitted.

 - Better handling of missing audio devices.

 - Improved and enhanced meta-data saved to .WAV files.

		  Release: WSJT-X 2.2.2
		       June 22, 2020
		  ---------------------

WSJT-X v2.2.2 is a bug fix release, mainly to incorporate the new RAC
section PE into the FT8/FT4/MSK144 Contest Mode for Field Day.

 - Stations intending to operate in Field Day (FD) are urged to
   upgrade to this release, without it you cannot set your section to
   PE, and of equal importance you cannot decode contest messages from
   stations who are operating from PE without this upgrade.

 - FT8 decoder speeded up in Normal and Fast modes. This change gives
   a speed of decoding closer to that of v2.1.2 without compromising
   the number of decodes. It is particularly targeted for slower
   single board computer users such as the Raspberry Pi Model 3 or
   similar.

 - Thanks to our user interface language translation contributors for
   many improvements to the translated strings.

 - The DX Grid field is now cleared automatically when the DX Call
   field is changed. Care should be taken to complete entry of a
   callsign before entering a grid square.


		  Release: WSJT-X 2.2.1
		       June 6, 2020
		  ---------------------

WSJT-X v2.2.1 is a bug fix release that fixes regressions found in the
prior v2.2.0 release. Here is a brief summary;

 - Incorporate a revised Hamlib version the address a regression in
   rig control of some rigs including the Yaesu FT-991 and FT-891.

 - Repair a defect in 6 character gridsquare lookup from the CALL3.TXT
   database, and improve "Lookup" button processing.

 - Repair a defect with selecting Wide Graph 2D spectrum types in
   translated UIs.

 - Repair a regression that blocked the Highlight Callsign UDP request
   from highlighting terms including a '+' character.

 - Repair a defect that caused hash code lookups of one's own call to
   fail after an extended period of inactivity, when operating with a
   non-standard callsign.

 - Repair  a  regression  where   occasional  Highlight  Callsign  UDP
   requests with the 'Highlight last'  parameter as true highlighted a
   match in a prior period. This fix include a performance improvement
   when  processing any  Highlight  Callsign  request with  'Highlight
   last' as true.

 - Include support for the Yaesu FT-920 when controlled by Ham Radio
   Deluxe. This change inadvertently missed the v2.2.0 GA release.

 - Correct a documentation issue with the UDP Message Protocol
   Status(1) message Special Operations Mode enumeration values ("WW
   DIGI added", Fox, and Hound renumbered). Thanks to Sam, W2JDB, for
   raising this issue.

 - Updated Catalan UI translation, tnx Xavi, EA3W.

 - Italian UI translation, tnx Marco, PY1ZRJ.

 - Updated Spanish UI translation, tnx Cédric, EA4AC. 


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.2
		       June 2, 2020
		   -------------------

WSJT-X 2.2 is a program upgrade that provides a number of new features
and capabilities.  Here is a brief summary; for further details see
the notes for candidate releases 2.2.0-rc1, -rc2, and -rc3, below, and
of course the updated WSJT-X 2.2 User Guide.

 - Significant improvements to the decoders for FT4, FT8, JT4, JT65,
   and WSPR.

 - New format for "EU VHF Contest" Tx2 and Tx3 messages

   When "EU VHF Contest" is selected, the Tx2 and Tx3 messages (those  
   conveying signal report, serial number, and 6-character locator)
   now use hashcodes for both callsigns.  This change is NOT backward
   compatible with earlier versions of _WSJT-X_, so all users of EU
   VHF Contest messages should be sure to upgrade to version 2.2.0.

 - Accessibility

   Keyboard shortcuts have been added as an aid to accessibility:
   Alt+R sets Tx4 message to RR73, Ctrl+R sets it to RRR.

   As an aid for partial color-blindness, the "inverted goal posts"
   marking Rx frequency on the Wide Graph's frequency scale are now
   rendered in a darker shade of green.

 - User Interface Translations have been enabled.  Translations are
   now available for Catalan, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Hong
   Kong Chinese.  Additiional languages will follow, when available.

   Note that UI translation is automatic, based on your system primary
   language. If you do not want the WSJT-X UI translated to your local
   language then start WSJT-X with the '--language=en' command line
   option:

   wsjtx --language=en

   If you wish to contribute by authoring WSJT-X UI translations
   please join the new discussion group wsjtx-l10n@Groups.io
   (https://groups.io/g/wsjtx-l10n), where help from other translation
   authors and coordination with the development team is available.

 - Minor enhancements and bug fixes

   "Save None" now writes no .wav files to disk, even temporarily.

   An explicit entry for "WW Digi Contest" has been added to
   "Special operating activities" on the "Settings | Advanced" tab.

   Contest mode FT4 now always uses RR73 for the Tx4 message.

   The Status bar now displays the number of decodes found in the
   most recent Rx sequence.

   The "Highlight Callsign" UDP message has been enhanced to allow
   clearing of old highlighting for a specified callsign. Please note
   a recommended restriction on the use of this message in the
   documentation here: https://tinyurl.com/y85nc3tg

 - Hamlib - this library which we use for direct rig control has had
   many defect repairs and enhancements, we thank the contributors to
   that project for their work.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc3
		          May 29, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc3 is the third release candidate for WSJT-X 2.2.0.

The most important differences from the -rc2 version are the
correction of regressions in hamlib code that affected particular
radios and PTT keying by means of DTR or RTS on a COM port.

In addition, RC3 has the following enhancements and minor bug fixes:

 - Updates to Catalan translation of the UI (thanks to EA3W)
 - Spanish translation of the UI (EA3W)
 - Load language translations only when matching primary language
 - Minor corrections to User Guide
 - Increased FT8 sync threshold in "Normal" and "Fast" decoding
 - Corrected the code that restores the WideGraph, EchoGraph, and
   FastGraph windows to normal view after they have been minimized.
 - Don't allow restart with "ISCAT B" mode label unless VHF features
   are enabled.
 - Repair regression defect in WSPR power combo box items


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc2
		          May 25, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc2 is a release candidate for WSJT-X 2.2.0.  The
following bugs present in the -rc1 version have been fixed:

 - Missing blank line between some decode sequences.
 - Improper functioning of "Start new period decodes at top".
 - Font selection caused crash on some macOS systems.
 - Mouse action in band selector box not right in some macOS systems.
 - Incorrect recall of Tx power setting in WSPR mode.
 - Many fixes to hamlib library and executables (rigctld, etc.).
 - Some regional settings did not allow WSJT-X to start.
 - Main window "looked like old Windows" in macOS.
 - Crash when "Ref Spec" is selected and no refspec.dat available.
 - Improper decoding of some FT4 messages with hashed "MyCall".
 - Crash after warning message about double-clicking in ISCAT mode.

In addition, we have made the following improvements:

 - Updated some figures and text in User Guide.
 - Corrected some formatting issues in the pdf version of User Guide.
 - Added some new sample files.
 - Improved shape and position of "green goal post" in Wide Graph.
 - Significantly reduced the rate of false decodes in FT4 and FT8.
 - Allow FT4 to use NA VHF Contest message formats.
 - Hold Tx frequency no longer cleared when switching between modes.
 - Added capability for translations of the user interface into
   languages other than English.  First working example (special
   thanks to Xavi Perez, EA3W!), is Catalan.  Spanish will be next.
 - Performance improvements to decode highlighting via UDP messages.

And finally:

Increasing FT8 usage on the popular bands 40, 30, and 20m means that
the default 3 kHz sub-bands are often wall-to-wall with signals.
Overcrowding encourages some to turn on their amplifiers, which only
makes things worse.  We are trying to coordinate the suggested
frequencies in WSJT-X with updated band plans being considered by
IARU, ARRL, and other amateur radio societies.

On a trial basis, and in response to numerous suggestions from around
the world, we have added a second set of suggested dial frequencies
for FT8 on three HF bands and also on 6 meters. The new suggested dial
frequencies are 7.071, 10.133, 14.071, and 50.310 MHz.  These
frequencies will appear in your drop-down band-selector list after you
go to the "Settings | Frequencies" tab, right-click on the frequency
table, and select "Reset".  Alternatively, you can add the new FT8
frequencies manually.

When the conventional FT8 sub-band on 6, 20, 30, or 40 m seems too
full, please try moving your dial frequency down 3 kHz!  Be aware that
as currently implemented, WSJT-X will set your dial to the lowest
frequency for the selected mode and band, when you switch bands.

See the next section for a list of other program improvements since
WSJT-X 2.1.2.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc1
		          May 10, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc1 is a beta-quality release candidate for a program
upgrade that provides a number of new features and capabilities.  These
include:

  - Improvements to the decoders for five modes:
 
      FT4: Corrected bugs that prevented AP decoding and/or multi-pass
      decoding in some circumstances.  The algorithm for AP
      decoding has been improved and extended.

      FT8: Decoding is now spread over three intervals.  The first
      starts at t = 11.8 s into an Rx sequence and typically yields
      around 85% of the possible decodes for the sequence.  You
      therefore see most decodes much earlier than before.  A second
      processing step starts at 13.5 s, and the final one at 14.7 s.
      Overall decoding yield on crowded bands is improved by 10% or
      more.  (Systems with receive latency greater than 0.2 s will see
      smaller improvements, but will still see many decodes earlier
      than before.)

      JT4: Formatting and display of Averaged and Deep Search decodes
      has been cleaned up and made consistent with other modes.
      Together with JT65 and QRA64, JT4 remains one of the digital
      modes widely for EME and other extreme weak-signal work on
      microwave bands.

      JT65: Many improvements for Averaged and Deep Search decodes and
      their display to the user.  These improvements are particularly
      important for EME on VHF and UHF bands.

      WSPR: Significant improvements have been made to the WSPR
      decoder's sensitivity, its ability to cope with many signals in
      a crowded sub-band, and its rate of undetected false decodes.
      We now use up to three decoding passes.  Passes 1 and 2 use
      noncoherent demodulation of single symbols and allow for
      frequency drifts up to ±4 Hz in a transmission.  Pass 3 assumes
      no drift and does coherent block detection of up to three
      symbols.  It also applies bit-by-bit normalization of the
      single-symbol bit metrics, a technique that has proven helpful
      for signals corrupted by artifacts of the subtraction of
      stronger signals and also for LF/MF signals heavily contaminated
      by lightning transients.  With these improvements the number of
      decodes in a crowded WSPR sub-band typically increases by 10 to
      15%.

 - New format for "EU VHF Contest" Tx2 and Tx3 messages

      When "EU VHF Contest" is selected, the Tx2 and Tx3 messages
      (those conveying signal report, serial number, and 6-character
      locator) now use hashcodes for both callsigns.  This change is
      NOT backward compatible with earlier versions of _WSJT-X_, so
      all users of EU VHF Contest messages should be sure to upgrade
      to versiion 2.2.0.

 - Accessibility

      Keyboard shortcuts have been added as an aid to accessibility:
      Alt+R sets Tx4 message to RR73, Ctrl+R sets it to RRR.

      As an aid for partial color-blindness, the "inverted goal posts"
      marking Rx frequency on the Wide Graph's frequency scale are now
      rendered in a darker shade of green.

 - Minor enhancements and bug fixes

      "Save None" now writes no .wav files to disk, even temporarily.

      An explicit entry for "WW Digi Contest" has been added to
      "Special operating activities" on the "Settings | Advanced" tab.

      Contest mode FT4 now always uses RR73 for the Tx4 message.

      The Status bar now displays the number of decodes found in the
      most recent Rx sequence.

Release candidate WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc1 will be available for beta-testing
for one month starting on May 10, 2020.  We currently plan a General
Availability (GA) release of WSJT-X 2.2.0 on June 1, 2020.

For those looking even farther ahead: We are well along in the
development of two new modes designed for the LF and MF bands.  One
mode is for WSPR-like activity and one for making 2-way QSOs.  Both
use Low-density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, 4-GFSK modulation, and
two-minute T/R sequences.  The QSO mode reaches threshold SNR
sensitivity around -31 dB on the AWGN channel, and the WSPR-like mode
better than -32 dB.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.1.1
		     November 25, 2019
		   ---------------------

                       Release: WSJT-X 2.0
                        December 10, 2018
                     -----------------------

WSJT-X 2.0 is a major update that introduces new protocols for FT8 and
MSK144.  The new protocols become the world-wide standards on December
10, 2018.

WSJT-X 2.0 cannot communicate in these modes with other stations using
WSJT-X v1.9.1 or earlier.

Please help by urging everyone to upgrade no later than January 1, 2019.

New features since WSJT-X v1.9.1:

1. Compound and nonstandard callsigns are automatically recognized and
handled using new message formats.

2. The new FT8 protocol provides optimized message formats for North
American VHF contests, European VHF contests, ARRL Field Day, and ARRL
RTTY Roundup.  Similarly, the new MSK144 protocol provides optimized
message formats for North American VHF and European VHF contests.
Full support is provided for "/R" and "/P" calls in the relevant
contests.

3. The new protocols provide nearly equal (or better) sensitivity
compared to the old ones, and lower false decode rates.

4. New logging features are provided for contesting and for "Fox"
(DXpedition) mode.  Logging is optionally integrated with N1MM Logger+
and WriteLog.

5. Color highlighting of decoded messages provides worked-before
status for callsigns, grid locators, DXCC entities, continents, CQ
Zones, and ITU zones on a “by band” and “by mode” basis, and for
stations that have uploaded their logs to Logbook of the World (LoTW)
within a specified time interval.

6. The WSPR decoder now achieves decodes down to S/N = -31 dB.  For
the particular benefit of LF/MF users, an option "No own call decodes"
has been added.

7. The UDP messages sent to companion programs have been expanded and
improved.

Some details of changes since WSJT-X-rc5 include the following:

 - Initial load of ADIF log in background
 - Correct the UTC displayed in Fox/Contest log
 - Faster entry and correct scrolling for Fox/Contest log
 - Add contest exchanges and contest type to UDP logged QSO message
 - Fix a bug that suppressed decodes with negative DT.
 - AK and HI are DXCCs, not states, for RTTY Roundup
 - Fix improper truncation of some non-FT8 messages in ALL.TXT
 - Various minor bug fixes and code cleanup
 - Update the WSJT-X User Guide to v2.0 (more to come...)
 - Update cty.dat


                     Release: WSJT-X 2.0-rc5
                        November 26, 2018
                     -----------------------

Release Candidate 5 ("RC5") is stable, works well, and fixes the known
problems in RC4.  It is likely that the General Availability (GA)
release of WSJT-X 2.0 will be nearly identical to RC5.

Changes from WSJT-X 2.0-rc4 include the following:

 -  Make the "Auto Seq" checkbox sticky, again
 -  Remove the 5-minute mouse timer
 -  Correct the "worked before" logic for color highlighting
 -  Add "No own call decodes" checkbox in WSPR mode
 -  Display and log UTC (not local time) in contest operations
 -  Validate contest QSO details before allowing logging
 -  Force Aqua theme on macOS to avoid issues with Mojave dark theme
 -  Move Fox log Reset action to Fox log window context menu
 -  Improve layout of Working Frequencies and Station Information tables
 -  Allow deletes and editing in Fox and Contest log windows
 -  Add Tool Tips for Fox and Contest log windows
 -  Fix a bug causing false AP decodes in JT65 VHF+ operation
 -  Fix a bug that could switch unexpectedly from JT65 to JT9 mode

PLEASE NOTE: As far as WSJT-X 2.0 (RC4, RC5, and GA releases) are
concerned, signals using the old FT8 protocol are undecodable
interference.  This means that regenerated replicas cannot be
subtracted from received data, and consequently second- and third-pass
decodes may be impeded.  Full performance of the 77-bit decoder will
not be realized until most signals on a crowded band are using the
new FT8 protocol.  


                     Release: WSJT-X 2.0-rc4
                        November 12, 2018
                     -----------------------

Changes from WSJT-X Version 2.0.0-rc3 include the following:

 -  Fix the "cannot open file fort.81" bug
 -  Avoid too many redirect loops related to openSSL support
 -  Fix the auto-generated messages for nonstandard callsigns
 -  Remove all support for the legacy FT8 protocol
 -  Disallow selecting MSK144 with RTTY or Field Day messages active
 -  Correct and expand support for color highlighting decoded messages
 -  ESC key aborts a QSO, clears DX Call, and selects Tx6
 -  Disable "nextCall" procedure for RTTY contest; it still needs work
 -  Correct a flaw in handling MSK144 Sh messages
 -  Prevent Fox from inadvertently toggling Tx 1st/Even
 -  Re-organize the Fox/Hound/Contest selection boxes
 -  Improve the validators for contest exchange boxes
 -  Disable Tx after 5 minutes of no mouse movement
 -  Remove end-of-line AP info when using contest messages
 -  Fix forwarding of Sent and Rcvd exchanges to N1MM+ and ADIF log
 -  Don't auto-log a QSO with incomplete exchange info
 -  Fix two sequencing flaws after double-clicks on a decoded msg
 -  New facilities for Contest and Fox-mode logging

                        September 25, 2018
                     -----------------------
Changes from WSJT-X Version 2.0.0-rc1 include the following:

 - Corrected a flaw that encoded a message's first callsign as
   hexadecimal telemetry data if the call consisted only of letters
   A-F and digits 0-9.

 - Corrected program logic that failed to identify certain callsigns
   as "nonstandard".

 - Fixed a bug that color-highlighted bare CQ messages (no grid
   locator) as "New DXCC".

 - Fixed a bug that failed to log Report Sent if MyCall is a
   nonstandard call.

 - Fixed a bug that generated incorrect MSK144 tones for certain
   messages and caused a "memory" effect on stations receiving the
   incorrect tones.

 - Fixed several bugs that could cause certain Tx messages to crash
   the program.

 - Suppressed the display of certain illogical false decodes.


                     Release: WSJT-X 2.0-rc1
                        September 17, 2018
                     -----------------------

This is the first candidate release on WSJT-X 2.0, intended for
beta-level testing.  For details see:

                   Release: WSJT-X Version 1.9.1
                           June 1, 2018
                   -----------------------------

This critical bug fix release repairs an unintended restriction in the FT8
DXpedition mode. It supersedes v1.9.0 and must be used for DXpedition Fox
operators.


                   Release: WSJT-X Version 1.9.0
                           May 28, 2018

  have the DXCC entity name assigned correctly in almost all cases

- Improved AFC capability for the wider JT65 sub-modes to help with
  drifting signals

- Better support for macOS using hi-DPI Retina displays

- New UDP message that allows external applications to highlight
  decoded callsigns

- Main-screen geometry and state of the "splitter" setting between its

Contacts in FT8 DXpedition Mode must use WSJT-X v1.9.0 at both ends of
the QSO.  Please report any anomalous behavior to email list
wsjt-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.  You must be a subscriber in order
to post there.


                Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0
                       October 27, 2017
                -----------------------------

This is the full General Availability release of WSJT-X Version 1.8.0.

Changes from WSJT-X Version 1.8.0-rc3 are very minor:

 - Right-click on the Wide Graph now pops up a Context Menu.  Select
   the item *Set Rx & Tx Offset* to complete a one-handed setting of
   both red and green frequency markers.

 - Several clarifications and additions to Tool Tips and the User Guide.


We recommend that all users should upgrade to WSJT-X Version 1.8.0.

If you upgrade from v1.8.0-rc1 it may be necessary to do a one-time
reset of the default list of suggested operating frequencies.  Go to
*File->Settings->Frequencies*, right click on the table and select
*Reset*.


                Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0-rc3
                        October 16, 2017
                ---------------------------------

Most (but not all) changes since Version 1.8.0-rc2 involve user
control of the increasingly popular FT8 mode.  The "RC3" release also
includes minor bug fixes and updates to the WSJT-X User Guide.  

The following list includes all of the more important changes:

- New optimization of GUI for simplex and split behavior in FT8 mode.

    1. Checkbox "Lock Tx Freq" on main window is relabeled "Hold Tx Freq".

    2. Double-clicking on decoded messages that do not contain your own
    call moves both Rx and Tx frequencies.  If the first callsign is
    your own call, only Rx freq moves.

    3. Double-clicking on decoded messages moves the Rx frequency.  If
    "Hold Tx Freq" is checked, Tx frequency is moved only if CTRL was
    held down.

    4. Clicking on the waterfall moves Rx and Tx frequencies as
    before: Rx only on a simple click, Tx only on SHIFT-click, and
    both on CTRL-click.  This happens even if "Hold Tx Freq" is
    checked. 

- Add a semi-automated "FreqCal" procedure: see *Solve for calibration
parameters* on the Tools menu.

- Improv auto-sequencing behavior: stop and on-frequency
transmission if a called station comes back to someone else.

- Improve S/N estimation in some situations involving QRM.

- Fix an initialization issue with user-modified application fonts.

- Fix an issue with Tx5 message generation with Type 2 compound calls.

- Enhance and improve the ADIF parser of logbook records.  Update
the band limits as per ADIF 3.0.6 specification.

- Increase the FT8 DT range to +/- 2.5 s.

- Do not allow window manager events to close the astronomical data
window.

- Add an "Erase" item to the context (right-click) menu for decoded
text.

- Extend UDP messages with an "off air" boolean field indicating that
the decode was derived from a .WAV file playback rather than an on air
reception.

- Extend reference applications to use the new off air decode message
field.

- Improve performance of FT8 decoder, especially for overlapping
signals.

- Allow specialized use of "x2 Tone Spacing" in FT8 and slow JT9
modes.

- Move "NA VHF Contest Mode" checkbox to main screen.  Query the
operator if d > 10000 km.

- Adjust UI to improve portability with font size changes and between
platforms.

- Extend UDP Reply message to support keyboard modifiers.  This allows
UDP servers to emulate keyboard modified double-clicks on decoded
messages, e.g. ALT+double-click for replying to a CQ or QRZ call
without changing ones Tx frequency offset.

- Update the cty.dat file (21st Sept 2017).

- Ensure that Fast Graph is properly initialized.

- Better handling of worked before and country name display.  Appended
text is added at a fixed column unless the message overlaps in which
case the appended information floats to the right.

- Restore printing of MSK144 decode quality information.

- Display Echo Graph automatically when Echo mode is started.

- Fix a bug that prevented double-click on a JT65 EME-style "OOO"
message from populating the Tx message boxes.

- Fixed behavior with double-click on 'CQ <AA-ZZ> <call> <grid>.'

- Update the "blank line" divider with band ID at 4*TRperiod/5.

- Fix cty.dat lookups that were not honouring exact match flags

- Add some further Copyright protections.

- Fix a bug involving "firstcall contains mycall" but not equal to mycall.

- Fix an issue with editing IARU regions in the working frequencies table.


                Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0-rc2
                        September 2, 2017
                ---------------------------------

Implementation of FT8 and its auto-sequencing feature is now more
capable and more polished.  The decoder is faster and better: it now
includes signal subtraction, multi-pass decoding, and the use of
accumulated "a priori" information as a QSO progresses.  Sensitivity
extends downward as far as -24 dB in some circumstances.  Overlapping
signals 2 and 3 deep are frequently decoded at essentially the same
frequency.  On a crowded band we sometimes see more than 30 decodes in
a single 15-second interval, over a 2 kHz window.  The North American
VHF Contesting Mode has been extended to include both FT8 and MSK144
modes.

The "RC2" release also includes many minor bug fixes and an
extensively updated WSJT-X User Guide.

Depending on what code revision you upgrade from, it may be necessary 
to do a one-time reset of the default list of suggested operating 
frequencies.  Go to *File->Settings->Frequencies*, right click on 
the table and select *Reset*. 


                Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0
                -----------------------------

NEW FEATURES IN WSJT-X Version 1.8.0
------------------------------------

1.  New mode called FT8: sensitivity down to -20 dB on the AWGN
    channel; QSOs 4 times faster than JT65 or JT9; auto-sequencing
    includes an option to respond automatically to first decoded
    reply to your CQ.

2.  New mode for accurate Frequency Calibration of your radio.

3.  Improved performance of decoders for JT65, QRA64, and MSK144.
    MSK144 includes facilities for amplitide and phase equalization
    and an "SWL" mode for short-format messages.
    
4.  Options to minimize screen space used by Main and Wide Graph
    windows.
    
5.  Enhanced management scheme for table of operating frequencies, and
    a new set of default frequencies specific to the three IARU
    Regions.
    
6.  Improved CAT control for many rigs, including those controlled
    through Commander or OmniRig.
    
7.  New keyboard shortcuts to set "Tx even/1st" ON or OFF.

8.  A number of (mostly minor) bug fixes and tweaks to the user
    interface.  For example: new behavior for the audio level slider;
    correctly logged QSO start times in certain situations; correct
    control of FT-891/991 and some other radios via rigctld.

At the time of the v1.8.0-rc1 release the following tasks are yet to
be completed:

1.  Updates to WSJT-X User Guide.
2.  Sample files for FT8.
3.  Enhanced decoding using AP ("a priori") information.
4.  Signal subtraction and multi-pass decoding.
5.  Option to Auto-respond to the weakest responder to your CQ.


Installation packages for Windows, Linux, OS X, and Raspbian can be 
downloaded from the WSJT web site:

wsjt-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.  Such reports should include a full
prescription of steps to reproduce the undesired behavior.  You must
be a subscriber to post to either of these lists.


                Brief Description of the FT8 Protocol
                -------------------------------------

WSJT-X Version 1.8.0 includes a new mode called FT8, developed by K9AN
and K1JT.  The mode name "FT8" stands for "Franke and Taylor, 8-FSK
modulation".  FT8 uses 15-second T/R sequences and provides 50% or
better decoding probability down to -20 dB on an AWGN channel.  An
auto-sequencing facility includes an option to respond automatically
to the first decoded reply to your CQ.  FT8 QSOs are 4 times faster
than those made with JT65 or JT9.  FT8 is an excellent mode for HF
DXing and for situations like multi-hop E_s on 6 meters, where deep
QSB may make fast and reliable completion of QSOs desirable.

Some important characteristics of FT8:

  - T/R sequence length: 15 s
  - Message length: 75 bits + 12-bit CRC
  - FEC code: LDPC(174,87)
  - Modulation: 8-FSK, tone spacing 6.25 Hz
  - Constant-envelope waveform
  - Occupied bandwidth: 50 Hz
  - Synchronization: 7x7 Costas arrays at start, middle, and end
  - Transmission duration: 79*1920/12000 = 12.64 s
  - Decoding threshold: -20 dB; several dB lower with AP decoding
  - Multi-decoder finds and decodes all FT8 signals in passband
  - Optional auto-sequencing and auto-reply to a CQ response
  - Operational behavior similar to JT9, JT65

We plan to implement signal subtraction, two-pass decoding, and use of
a priori (AP) information in the decoder.  These features are not yet
activated in v1.8.0.

We haven't yet finalized what the three extra bits in the message
payload will be used for.  Suggestions are welcome!

WSJT-X v1.6.0 Release Notice
============================

New Features
------------

WSPR  mode, including  coordinated  automatic band-hopping  and a  new
two-pass decoder that can decode overlapping signals.

EME-motivated features  including JT4  (submodes A-G), Echo  mode, and
automatic Doppler  tracking.  The JT4  decoder is more  sensitive than
that in  the latest  WSJT, and message  averaging is  fully automated.
(Note that submodes  JT65B and JT65C are also present  in Version 1.6,
but the high-sensitivity decoder required for EME with JT65 is not yet
included.)

Tools for accurate frequency calibration of  your radio, so you can be
always on-frequency to within about 1 Hz.

Mode-specific  standard   working  frequencies  accessible   from  the
drop-down band selector.


Maintenance
-----------

A  number  of   corrections  to  the  Hamlib   library,  fixing  balky
rig-control  features.    A  few   unreliable  features   peculiar  to
particular radios have been removed.




WSJT-X v1.5.0 Release Notice
============================

Decoder Performance Improvements
--------------------------------

The most notable change in v1.5.0 is improved speed and quality of the
JT9 and JT65 decoders.  Algorithms have been fine-tuned, and advantage
is taken of the multiple CPUs  found on most modern computers. Overall
speedup factors of  three or more have been attained  since the v1.4.0
release and more signals are being successfully decoded as well.

For  those  interested, here's  a  summary  of  speed tests  of  three
benchmark  versions  of  WSJT-X,  based on  reading  and  decoding  an
identical  set of  10,682 *.wav  files.   The files  were recorded  on
various bands from 160 m to 10 m; the number of decodable JT65 signals
is typically about  5 times the number of JT9  signals.  For each test
the program was set to "JT9+JT65"  mode with "Deepest" selected on the
*Decode* menu.   Other setup parameters  were identical in  all cases.
The test  computer runs Windows 7  and has an Intel  i5-2500 processor
with 4 CPUs.

Columns  labeled "JT9"  and "JT65"  in  the following  table give  the
number of decoded signals in each  mode.  Numbers in the "Time" column
are total  processing time  in seconds,  and columns  labaled "Factor"
give ratios of the corresponding numbers, relative to WSJT-X v1.3.

Program Version  JT9 Factor   JT65 Factor   Time Factor
-------------------------------------------------------
v1.3 r3673      7691  1.000  40831  1.000  14061  1.00
v1.4.0          7693  1.000  41796  1.024  13320  1.06
v1.5.0-rc1      8024  1.043  43946  1.076   4224  3.32

On the  benchmark computer the  decoder in  v1.5.0-rc1 is more  than 3
times faster than the ones in  program releases v1.3 r3673 and v1.4.0.
At the  same time, the number  of decoded signals has  increased by as
much as 7.6%.

Users will notice another consequence  of taking advantage of multiple
CPUs.  JT65  and JT9 decodes in  dual "JT9+JT65" mode are  now done in
parallel, so decodes  are delivered to the Rx activity  window as they
are decoded rather than finishing the current mode before starting the
other mode.   Decoding at the  QSO frequency is still  given priority,
but it may not be the first decode displayed because the first decodes
of the other mode may be produced more quickly.  Dual mode decodes are
now interleaved in the Rx activity window.


UDP Broadcast
-------------

WSJT-X v1.5.0 introduces a new facility that broadcasts status, decode
and logged  QSO information  via the  network. Although  this facility
gives  no obvious  change  to the  application other  than  a few  new
settings options, it should allow cooperating applications to interact
with WSJT-X  far more smoothly  than the current file  based mechanism
which  is prone  to  contention.  The file  access  contention can  be
detrimental to both WSJT-X and the cooperating application whereas the
new broadcast mechanism will not.

Currently the only only cooperating application we know of is JTAlertX
by Laurie VK3AMA and that currently  uses the file based mechanism. We
hope that  Laurie will try the  new mechanism but we  will continue to
provide the file based mechanism as well. We also know of at least one
other application in development for the Apple Mac platform to provide
similar features to  JTAlertX. A contribution for Linux  would also be
most welcome.


Rig Control
-----------

This continues  to be  an area  of development.  There are  still many
untested combinations of equipment since we  have to wait until a user
tries WSJT-X for the first time with each combination before we can be
sure that any defects have been  removed. Hundreds of hours of testing
have been done and we thank those who have reported issues and offered
their time to test fixes where necessary.


FlexRadio & HPSDR Users
-----------------------

Currently the  Hamlib library that  we use  for direct CAT  control of
your  rigs does  not  provide  a fully  functioning  driver for  these
radios. Instead the TS-2000 emulation mode  of these SDRs must be used
as the Hamlib driver for this  has tweaks added to cooperate correctly
with SDRs.  Version  v1.4 of WSJT-X did not work  with these radios in
TS-2000 emulation mode  and at the time we were  not informed of that,
it  appears to  have become  common  knowledge that  using the  TS-480
emulation mode was  the correct procedure, this  is incorrect although
it did work at the time.  The  TS-480 emulation may cease to work in a
future version because it  is due to a defect in  Hamlib that it works
at all. The TS-2000 emulation mode is the correct selection and should
be used with these radios.


Generated Messages for Type 1 and Type 2 Compound Callsigns
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is  a complex  area because  it requires  special action  by both
parties in a  QSO since the automatically  generated standard messages
are not always suitable. We have tried to improve the standard message
generation and recognition  along with better recognition  of own call
messages. As before it is imperative that operators take note of their
QSO partners responses  and be prepared to manually  edit replies when
communicating with compound callsign stations.


                                                         

WSJT-X v1.4.0 Release Notice
============================

Migration of User Files
-----------------------

This  release includes  a new  install mechanism  that separates  user
files  from installation  and  program files.  This  means that  going
forward  upgrades  will be  seamless  with  user files  preserved  and
automatically  carried forward  without  user  intervention. For  this
release only it  is necessary to move your user  files manually if you
wish to  preserve them. The locations  of user files have  changed and
now vary depending  on the installation platform.  The following notes
are intended  to guide you  in moving your user  files, this is  a one
time action.

On Microsoft Windows:

The  new  location  for  user  files is  %LOCALAPPDATA%  which  is  an
environment variable defined automatically by Windows, you may use the
environment variable  any place  where a file  path would  normally be
used e.g.   in the location entry  bar in Windows File  Explorer or in
arguments to command line programs from a Command Prompt window.

On Linux and other Unix systems:

The new location for user files ~/.local/share

On Mac:

The new location for user files is ~/Library/Application\ Support

In all cases  the files are stored in a  subdirectory which by default
is WSJT-X

In the case of users who run  multiple instances of WSJT-X on a single
computer   there  are   different   user  file   locations  for   each
instance. The non-default locations are in sibling subdirectories each
suffixed by  the rig name  argument passed  to WSJT-X at  startup (See
Running Multiple Instances below).

The user  files that you  may wish to  migrate from older  versions of
WSJT-X are:

  ALL.TXT
  CALL3.TXT
  wsjtx.log
  wsjtx_log.adi

The format of each  of these files is unchanged in  WSJT-X v1.4 so all
that is  needed is to  copy them to the  new location.

For example on  Microsoft Windows assuming a  WSJT-X v1.3 installation
in C:\WSJT\wsjtx-1.3, using a command prompt window:

  copy C:\WSJT\wsjtx-1.3\ALL.TXT %LOCALAPPDATA%\WSJT-X\
  copy C:\WSJT\wsjtx-1.3\CALL3.TXT %LOCALAPPDATA%\WSJT-X\
  copy C:\WSJT\wsjtx-1.3\wsjtx.log %LOCALAPPDATA%\WSJT-X\
  copy C:\WSJT\wsjtx-1.3\wsjtx_log.adi %LOCALAPPDATA%\WSJT-X\

On Linux:

  cp ~/wsjtx-1.3/ALL.TXT ~/.local/share/WSJT-X/
  cp ~/wsjtx-1.3/CALL3.TXT ~/.local/share/WSJT-X/
  cp ~/wsjtx-1.3/wsjtx.log ~/.local/share/WSJT-X/
  cp ~/wsjtx-1.3/wsjtx_log.adi ~/.local/share/WSJT-X/

On Mac:

  cp ~/wsjtx-1.3/ALL.TXT ~/Library/Application\ Support/WSJT-X/
  cp ~/wsjtx-1.3/CALL3.TXT ~/Library/Application\ Support/WSJT-X/
  cp ~/wsjtx-1.3/wsjtx.log ~/Library/Application\ Support/WSJT-X/
  cp ~/wsjtx-1.3/wsjtx_log.adi ~/Library/Application\ Support/WSJT-X/

If you have a customized cty.dat  file installed, then that too should
be copied to the new directory.


Settings
--------

WSJT-X v1.4 introduces a new settings  regime. There is no facility to
migrate  settings  from  prior  versions  and  copying  the  wsjtx.ini
settings file to  the new user files location will  not carry over any
useful information.   The new settings  dialog is very  different from
prior versions but it is intuitive and will not take long to configure
for you equipment and preferences.


Running Multiple Instances
--------------------------

For users  with multiple radios  or multi-receiver SDRs  WSJT-X offers
multiple  instance  support.   Prior  to  WSJT-X  v1.4  this  involved
installing the application multiple  times in separate locations, this
is  no longer  necessary and  multiple instances  MUST be  run from  a
single installation. This is possible  as user and other writable data
files are stored in a unique location for each instance.

WSJT-X  has  a  new  command line  option  that  coordinates  multiple
instances called --rig-name (-r for  short) which allow you to specify
a unique key for each instance.  If no --rig-name option is supplied a
default  location is  used  for  writable files  as  specified in  the
Migrating of User  Files section above. If a key  is provided then the
same key  must be used  every time that instance  is started so  as to
associate it with the correct data files.

If the  unique key were ft-857  then you must start  WSJT-X using that
key e.g.

   wsjtx --rig-name=ft-857

and the data files will be stored in a directory "WSJT-X - ft-857" for
example on Windows:

   "%LOCALAPPDATA%\WSJT-X - ft-857\"

Multiple instance support  may also be used if more  than one operator
uses the same computer with their own call signs, or a single operator
who  operates  in multiple  locations  with  different call  signs  or
wishing to maintain separate log files for each location.


Known Issues
------------

Editing station details in the  frequencies tab of the settings window
may not  save the changes to  the settings file. Updates  will show in
the settings tables until application exit  but may not be used by the
application.  A workaround  is  available, delete  the  whole row  and
re-enter  the details  rather  than editing  individual fields.   This
defect is resolved in the next release (v1.5).




                        WSJT-X ChangeLog
------------------------------------------------------------------
October 7, 2013: Version 1.2.1, r3590

Windows Vista has a broken rate converter which gets invoked when an
input audio stream at 48kHz sample rate is requested.  To correct this
problem, WSJT-X revision 3590 reverts to input sampling at 12000 Hz by
default when run under Vista.  All other platforms use 48000 Hz sample
rate for both input and output.

October 3, 2013: Version 1.2.1, r3587

1. Input sample rate is now uniformly 48000 Hz on all supported
platforms.

2. Properly handle DNS lookup failures for PSKreporter site.

3. Clear the logbook "Name" field after logging a QSO.

4. Add tuning paramegters for better audio performance on some machines.

5. Improved handling of displayed text when larger fonts are used.

6. Fix message truncation when a callsign is unexpectedly long.

7. Fix the "stuck decode" bug experienced by some users.

8. Remove the bogus error message sometimes printed upon program exit.


August 17, 2013: Version 1.2, r3563
------------------------------------
Changes since revision 3556 include the following:

1. Fix bug preventing program restart with "+2 kHz" already set.

2. Fix bug causing problems if program is installed in a directory
with embedded space(s) in the name.

3. Fixed an audio input problem (seen on some computers) by moving
audio input to the audio thread, running at High Priority.

4. Re-enabled the capability for running multiple instances.

August 16, 2013: Version 1.2, r3556
------------------------------------
Changes since code revision 3520 include the following:

1. Audio I/O now uses Qt's built-in multimedia library inatead of
PortAudio.  User options are provided for input (mono/left/right) and
output (mono/left/right/both), and a digital attenuation slider to
control Tx audio level.  In "Split Tx" mode, Tx signals are now
cleaner because Tx audio is constrained to the range 1500 - 2000 Hz.

2. Windows reports to PSKReporter now use our own code, rather than
PSKReporter.dll.

3. Many new optional palettes for waterfall colors, selectable from a
drop-down list on the Wide Graph window.

4. Fixed bug causing misalignment of Cumulative spectrum when start
frequency is not 0.  Decoding begins at start frequency rather than 
0 Hz.

5. Tx message #6 is now selected at program startup.

6. Faster logbook lookup when "Show DXCC entity and worked B4 status"
is selected.  Also better ADIF compatibility and better text alignment
in left and right text windows.

7. Improved Tool Tips for on-screen controls.

8. Various other code changes for uniformity across platforms, ease of
maintenance, and good programming practice.  (Most of these will be
invisible to users.)

9. Program is now built with the latest Qt, version 5.1.

10. Updates to User's Guide.


August 2, 2013: Version 1.1.1, r3520
------------------------------------
Improvements since Version 1.1, r3496 include the following:

1. New organization of the "Band Settings" tab on the configuration
screen, including antenna descriptions for PSK Reporter on a "per
band" basis.

2. Full control is provided for DTR and RTS lines on the serial port
used for CAT control.

3. Optional user control of font sizes.  Use a text editor to create a
file "fonts.txt" in the WSJT-X installation directory.  It should have
four numbers on a single line.  The first two are point size and
weight (0-100 scale) for GUI labels, the next two are point size and
weight for the decoded text windows.  For example, try "9 50 12 100".

4. New user control at bottom of Wide Graph window sets the start
frequency of the waterfall scale.

5. New optional palette "gray1" for the waterfall.

6. The small colored button just right of the "+2 kHz" checkbox now
shows the letter "S" if "Split Tx" has been checked.

7. New user option appends DXCC country name and "QSO B4" status to
decoded CQ messages.

8. Setting of dial frequencies through Commander should should now
be aware of local convention for decimal separator.

9. Several minor bug fixes.

10. Refactoring of code to move audio input.output into the GUI thread.
(Should be invisible to users).

11. Updated credits displayed in the "About" window.

12. Updated User's Guide.


July 19, 2013: Version 1.1, r3496
---------------------------------
This is a full release of WSJT-X Version 1.1.  It provides an easy way
to make QSOs in both JT65 and JT9 modes.  

Changes from the most recent beta release, r3487, include the
following:

1. Significant optimizations of the JT9 decoder, providing speed 
improvements up to 5 times.

2. Frequency-setting through DX Lab Commander now works properly at
non-integral kHz frequencies.

3. A new meter widget has been added (thanks to PY2SDR).

4. Implementation of "multiple instances" has been completed and
tested (thanks to KK1D). 

5. Several minor bug fixes.


July 15, 2013: Version 1.1 Beta Release, r3487
----------------------------------------------

Version 1.1 of WSJT-X is "bi-lingual" -- it transmits and receives
both JT9 and JT65 signals, switching between modes automatically as
needed.  The maximum displayed bandwidth has been increased from 1 to
5 kHz.  If your receiver has an upper-sideband filter at least 4 kHz
wide, on most bands you can have all the JT65 *and* all the JT9
activity on screen at once, available for making QSOs.

Other improvements since v1.0, r3323 include the following:

1. CAT control via DxLab Commander.

2. Improved GUI appearance, especially on Linux and OS X.

3. Compilable with Qt5 as well as Qt4.

4. Fixed occasional program crashes caused by receiving a message in
the form "call1 call2" (with no grid, report, etc.).

5. Improved handling of audio device selection in Linux.

6. Log QSO frequency, instead of dial frequency only.

7. Added Tx Power to ADIF log information.

8. Added option to retain between QSOs the Power and Comments fields
for ADIF and wsjtx logs.

9. Added optional antenna description for PSK Reporter.

10 Fixed a bug in handling of logged grid locator when none was
available on the double-clicked line.

11. Fixed a bug that caused small differences in the lengths of
transmitted symbols.  This leads to improved decoding.

12. Tx message (highlighted in yellow) now includes a mode flag and
the audio offset from dial frequency.

13. Added a spinner control for Rx Freq.

14. New on-screen button "Lock Tx=Rx" locks Tx and Rx frequencies
together.

15. Allow Windows COM port number greater than 9.

16. Don't clear DxGrid when user double-clicks on a message with no
grid, if the message's Tx call is same as DxCall.

17. Double-click on yellow Tx message now sets frequency, but does
nothing else.

18. Rationalized the logic of the CAT control indicator button. Now
colored grey/green/orange/red -- see User's Guide.

19. Operating in "Split Tx" mode is optional (but with most radios is
necessary if you will transmit at more than 2.7 kHz above dial
frequency).

20. The correct TxMode label now appears on program startup.

21. "Transmitting..." message in ALL.TXT now has the correct TxMode.

22. File wsjt_status.txt includes TxMode.

23. F4 clears Az, Dist, and the Tx message boxes.

24. You can decode JT9 signals in the JT65 frequency range, and
vice-versa, by double-clicking the signal in the waterfall.

25. Better logic for enabling/disabling the TestPTT button.

26. Do not call getFreq() when the TestPTT button is clicked and
PTTmethod is via CAT control.

27. New cold-start default frequencies are set at reasonable values
for JT65.  A "+2 kHz" checkbox is provided for quick setup in JT9-only
mode.

28. Default macros added as simple examples.

In case you wondered about r3482, which was posted for a few hours 
only...

It was repleced by r3487 in order to fix two bugs.  Revision 3487 
uses more sensible logic for what to do when the "DX Grid" entry is 
edited, and it fixes a bug that could prevent program restart if 
you had exited the program with "+2 kHz" checked.

May 30, 2013: Version 1.0, r3323
--------------------------------

With this release of WSJT-X Version 1.0 we include a few (relatively
minor) enhancements in response to user requests, as well as some
program polishing and cleanup.  Active program development will
continue, but new releases will become less frequent.

1. New option on the Setup menu: "Tx freq locked to Rx freq".

2. Double-click on a decoded "73" message now sets Tx5, rather than Tx6.

3. New keyboard shortcuts: Alt+1 through Alt+6 set the next Tx message 
   at the corresponding number.

4. PTT control via Ham Radio Deluxe has been imnplemented and tested.

5. "Tool Tips" are now provided for most on-screen controls.

6. Under Linux and OS X, listings of available audio devices and APIs
   have been corrected.

7. Tab order among GUI controls has been cleaned up.

8. Updates to the WSJT-X User's Guide.


May 22, 2013: v0.99, r3297
--------------------------

1. CAT control via Ham Radio Deluxe is now available.  For setup
   details see item #5 at the top of page 6 of the updated WSJT-X
   User's Guide.

2. Submodes JT9-5, JT8-10, JT9-30 have been de-activated.  (As far as I
   know, nobody was using them.)  This action makes the program smaller 
   by some 150 MB and able to run effectively on some older computers.

3. Bizarre ordering of COM port numbers on the drop-down list has been
   corrected, and suitable serial ports added to the list displayed in
   Linux.

4. Gray bar between decoding periods now contains a dashed line.

5. Corrected a bug that prevented use of Setup | Configuration with
   no existing wsjtx.ini file.

May 17, 2013: v0.95, r3278
--------------------------
1.  Double-clicking on a decoded text line in "Band Activity" window
    now copies the line into the "QSO Frequency" window if it was not
    already there.

2.  Option "Color highlighting in left window" removed from Setup
    menu.  Highlighting is now always done.

3.  Positions of "QSO Frequency" and "Band Activity" windows have been
    swapped.  

4.  F4 was restored to its previous use; F5 is now used to display
    Special Mouse Commands

5.  Small square between Band selector and Frequency readout was made
    a control button.  Orange indicates one-way CAT control from
    program to radio, red indicates bi-directional control.  Clicking
    the orange button causes a one-time readout of dial frequency.

6.  If Save=None, the last recorded file is deleted on program exit.
    This prevents unwanted accumulation of files in the Save
    directory.

7.  Status-bar messages were re-arranged in a more logical order.

8.  Tx signal report was added to wsjtx_status.txt (for JT-Alert)

9.  More informative labels were placed on the "Tab 2" GUI controls.

10. Better default scaling for the "Cumulative" spectrum.

11. New algorithm for identifying JT9 signals to send to decoder,
    resulting major improvements in decoder speed.

12. Bug fixes:
     - Incorrect displayed frequencies for JT9-2 signals
     - Infinitely repeated "Error rigOpen -1" messages
     - User tries to open CAT control using busy or nonexistent serial port

13. Many updates to the User's Guide


May 2, 2013: v0.95, r3251
-------------------------

1. The "band change" function is executed whenever the Band combobox
   is activated, even if the selected band has not changed.

2. The program does not set rig mode.  That task is left to the user.

3. Time interval for polling rig frequency is now a user parameter on
   the setup screen.  I set mine to 1 second, which works fine with
   the Kenwood TS-2000.  Set it to 0 if you want no polling for
   frequency (which means unidirectional CAT control from program to
   radio).  Choose something like 10 s for the K3.

4. Much new work on the WSJT-X User's Guide, which is approaching its
   final form for Version 1.0.  Please read it and tell us about
   anything you find unclear or missing!

These changes address nearly all of the CAT issues found by a few
users -- those with K3, IC-746, IC-706, in particular.  

One additional piece of advice when running WSJT-X in Windows: connect
and turn on the radio and any interface equipment before starting
WSJT-X, and exit the program before turning such equipment off.

April 29, 2013: v0.95, r3243
----------------------------

1. Now has bi-directionsl CAT control using direct calls to hamlib
   functions.  Highlights displayed dial frequency with red background
   if frequency differs from nominal for the selected band by more
   than 100 kHz.  (Is there a more useful or logical condition to
   flag?)  Small red square between Band selector and Dial Frequency
   display to indicate that CAT control is active.  Mode is set to USB
   on startup.  (Note: CAT control diagnostics are presently rather
   rudimentary, we're still working on this.  Feedback is welcome!)

2. New controls on Setup | Configuration screen: 
   - RTS/DTR OFF -- needed by K2 and maybe other radios
   - Data / Mic -- select CAT-control PTT type
   - Test CAT Control -- try settings before returning to main screen
   - Test PTT -- try settings for toggling PTT On/Off

3. Help menu now provides displays of Keyboard Shortcuts (quick access
   via F3) and Special Mouse Commands (F4).

4. Option "Setup | Advanced | Allow multiple instances" enables the
   use of more than one instance of WSJT-X for special applications.
   (The program must be copied into and run from different
   directories.)

5. No posts to PSK Reporter if band was changed during the reception
   period.

6. Improved behavior of Tune button.

7. Improved inter-process communication between WSJT-X and JT-Alert-X.

8. Better interaction between "Report" spinner control and Tx messages.

9. Removed the NB checkbox and slider.  (Has anyone found these useful?)

10. New buttons on main window: "Tx=Rx" sets Tx frequency to current
    Rx frequency; "Rx=Tx" does the opposite.

11. Log QSO confirmation window is now "non-modal": you can keep it 
    open and still access controls on the main window.

12. Tab-order has been rationalized on most screens.

13. Dial frequency and mode written to file ALL.TXT.

14. Double-click on decoded line sets Tx message #3 if message has
     the form "MyCall Call2 rpt".

15. Bug causing occasional, seemingly unpredictable program crashes
    has been fixed.

16. The WSJT-X User's Guide is somewhat closer to being complete.  User
    feedback on the Guide will be most welcome.  What is unclear?  What
    is missing?

April 17, 2013: v0.9, r3195
---------------------------
1. Sorry, the CAT control changes in r3187/3188 were a dismal failure
in many stations, and they introduced other bugs as well.  This revision
goes back to uni-directional CAT control: the program can set the 
radio's dial frequency and do T/R switching, but that's all.  The band
setting is not reset on program startup.

2. Logic for the Tune button has been corrected.

3. For Linux compile-it-yourself enthusiasts: the interface to 
PSK Reporter is now working undel Linux.

April 16, 2013: v0.9, r3188
---------------------------

1. CAT control now reads and follows changes in radio's dial
frequency.  Readout gets red highlighting if radio is on wrong band.
On program restart, band is reset to the last selected band.

2. New "Tune" button generates an unmodulated carrier.  Toggle button
a second time to turn Tx off.

3. Added labels at top of "Tab 2" and enlarged the text entry fields.

4. Fixed the broken logic for "Runaway Tx watchdog".

5. Fixed "Prompt me to log QSO" so that it no longer requires also
setting "ID after 73".

6. Additional changes of (eventual) interest to Linux users.  Code for
sending spots to PSK Reporter now in place.

April 13, 2013: v0.9, r3166
---------------------------
1. Option to send Tx messages (highlighted in yellow) to the QSO window.

2. Prevent starting a transmission more than 24 sec into a Tx period.

3. "Setup | Options" changed to "Setup | Configuration".

4. Type Alt-V to save the most recently completed Rx file.

5. Fixed bug that truncated Rx messages to 16 characters.

6. Internal program changes that should provide better user diagnostics
when necessary at program startup.

April 11, 2013: v0.9, r3157
---------------------------
1. Maximum size of several window areas increased to accommodate system 
fonts set larger than default.

2. New behavior of Erase button: click once to erase the left (QSO) window,
twice to erase both decoded text windows.

3. Keyboard shortcuts:
   Alt-D: decode again at QSO frequency (same as clicking the Decode() button)
   Shift-D: do another full decode in both windows
   Alt-E: Erase()
   Ctrl-F: Edit the free text message box
   Alt-H: Halt Tx()
   Alt M: Monitor()
   Alt-N: Enable Tx()
   Alt-Q: Log QSO()
   Alt-S: Stop()

4. New Setup options: "Tx disabled after sending 73" and "Runaway Tx 
watchdog".

5. Fixed bug in saving the "report received" for logging purposes.

6. Corrected the logic for "Runaway Tx watchdog".

7. Fixed bug that truncated characters 17 and 18 of decoded messages.

April 10, 2013: v0.9, r3151
---------------------------
1. Blank line between decoding periods is now in the right-hand 
text window, where it should be.
2. Decoding range defined by fMin and fMax is now enforced.

April 9, 2013: v0.9, r3143
--------------------------
This minor release restores the decoding speed of earlier revisions
and corrects a bug that prevented sending CW ID.

April 9, 2013: v0.9, r3142
--------------------------

This version of WSJT-X has a number of significant changes.  Please
read the following notes carefully.  Also -- even if you are already
familiar with WSJT-X -- be sure to read the updated WSJT-X User's 
Guide at 
http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT-X_Users_Guide.pdf ,
especially pages 3 and 4.

Changes since v0.8 r3118 include the following:

1. There are now two scrolling windows for decoded text.  The left
window contains decodes only from close to the designated QSO
frequency.  The right window includes signals over the full decoding
range.

2. An alternative set of controls is now available for generating and
selecting Tx messages.  Some may find these more convenient to use
than the Tx1 through Tx6 message boxes.

3. A number of new user options are available on the Setup menu:
   - Blank line between decoding periods (right window only)
   - Clear DX Call and DX Grid after logging QSO
   - Display distances in miles
   - Runaway Tx watchdog
   - Background colors for left window
   - Double-click on decoded message sets Tx Enable

4. New or changed on-screen features
   - "Tol" replaced by fMin and fMax on waterfall screen (see User's Guide)
   - Spinner control for signal report
   - On waterfall scale: green marker for Rx freq, red for Tx. blue
     for decoding range

5. New behavior
   - "CQ DX" is now treated properly when decoded line is double-clicked
   - Message formate for compound callsigns (e.g., PJ4/K1ABC, G4XYZ/P)
     are now handled correctly.  (Some restrictions apply, and will
     be spelled out in the completed User's Guide.)
   - Decode button now causes a decode only at the specified Rx frequency.
   - Click on waterfall spectrum sets Rx freq; double-click also invokes
     decoder (as though Decode button had been clicked).  CTRL-click moves
     both Rx and Tx freqs.
   - Amplitude at end of transmission is ramped down to prevent a final
     key click.

6. The following bugs have been fixed:
   - Logic error in decoder
   - Certain non-standard Tx messages could cause a program crash.
   - Certain (rarely used) messages did not pack/unpack correctly

April 2, 2013: v0.8, r3118
--------------------------
1. Improved interface to program JT-Alert, by VK3AMA.

2. The LogQSO confirmation dialog no longer blocks the GUI updating
   process.

3. A blank line with gray background separates the decoded text lines for
   each new invocation of the decoder.

4. New suggested default frequencies: 5.357, 18.104, and 24.918 MHz.  
   Be sure to edit these entries on the 'Default Frequencies' tab of the
   Setup screen.  (When you have done this once, the new values will be
   remembered.)

5. The LogQSO button now does nothing is the 'DX call' entry field is
   blank.

6. Several minor bugs were fixed.


March 27, 2013: v0.8, r3113
---------------------------
1. Bug fix: VOX control of T/R switching now works.

2. Potentially useful error messages now appear when CAT control
   has failed.

3. Added an instruction on the Log QSO confirmation screen.

4. Clear the DXcall and DXgrid entries after logging a QSO.

March 26, 2013: v0.8, r3112
---------------------------

Edson Pereira, PY2SDR, recently became an active contributor to this
open-source project.  Edson and I have been very busy over the past
few days!  WSJT-X revision 3112 has many changes and new features.

1. The GUI layout has been adjusted and optimized.

2. CAT control is now operational, offering optional control of your
   radio's dial frequency and T/R status.  Go to the Setup | Options
   window to select the necessary parameters.

3. CW ID has been implemented.  You can have your ID sent after a fixed 
   time interval, or automatically when you transmit a "73" or free
   text message.  

4. Default dial frequencies are available for each band on a new tab
   on the Setup | Options window.  Please note: some of these
   frequencies are probably wrong!  You can edit them as needed.  
   (Please let us know if the original values are inconsistent with
   actual practice on any band.)

5. Several new options appear on the Setup menu.  Try them!

6. Azimuth and Distance information is displayed whenever a valid grid
   locator appears in the "Dx Grid" box.

7. The decoder has again been adjusted for better compromise between
   sensitivity and decoding time.  
   
8. The User's Guide is out of date, and needs work.  We hope to get to
   that task soon.

9. Very important for some would-be users: WSJT-X now runs properly
   under Linux.  We haven't made a package yet, so for now you must
   compile your own.  If you don't know how, we hope to be set up
   to make packages before too long.

10. If you know someone who might be interested in contributing to the
    development of WSJT-X and related projects, please send him/her
    our way!  We're especially looking for someone interested in
    producing packaged Linux distributions -- for example, *.deb or
    *.rpm packages, but other programming help is also wanted.

As always: please report bugs, and don't be bashful about sending us
your feature requests!

March 22, 2013: v0.7, r3071
---------------------------
1. Correct a bug that (still) allowed display of previous decodes
when nothing new was decoded.

2. Add a user confirmation screen activated when you click Log QSO.
This lets you edit or add information before it is written to the
ADIF file.

3. Tx message macros and now available.  Configure them on the Setup 
window.  They are invoked as a pop-up menu by right-clicking on the 
Tx5 message window; then select the desired message by left-clicking 
on the desired message. 

March 20, 2013: v0.7, r3063
---------------------------
1. Add Frequency to the generated ADIF records.

2. Correct a decoder bug that led to duplication of previous output 
when nothing new was decoded.

March 19, 2013: v0.7, r3061
---------------------------
1. Allow Windows COM port numbers up to 99.

2. Replace status files wsjtx_qrg.txt and wsjtx_txcall.txt with
a single file, wsjtx_status.txt.

3. Combine wsjtx_rx.log and wsjtx_tx.log into a single file ALL.TXT.

4. "Log QSO" now writes a file in ADIF format.

5. Starting to implement popup macros for Tx message #5.

6. Big improvement in decoding speed.

*** More changes to come!  Please report any problems, especially
*** with the ADIF-format log.

March 12, 2013: v0.6, r3046
---------------------------
1. Decoded calls can now be uploaded to the PSK Reporter web site. 
Check the box "Enable PSK Reporter" on the Setup screen, and go to
http://pskreporter.info/pskmap.html to see the spots.  Be sure to
enter your "Dial Frequency (MHz)" at lower right of the Wide Graph
window.  (Rig control features are yet to come...)

2. Added some interfaces to permit use with the program JT-Alert,
by VK3AMA.  Look for this capability in the near future. 

March 6, 2013: v0.5, r3038
--------------------------
1. Selection of Current/Cumulative/JT9Sync for the 2d spectral display
changed to a combobox.

2. Double-click on decoded text does not change frequency settings
if first decoded call is MyCall.

March 1, 2013: v0.5, r3026
--------------------------
1. The horizontal scale of 2d spectra (e.g., the "red curve") is now
correct when the user has selected FFT Bins/Pixel > 1.

2. Double-clicking on a decoded text line now selects the second
callsign independent of exactly where one has clicked on the line.  
In addition, it sets the selected frequencies (both Tx and Rx) to
the frequency of the decoded transmission.

December 11, 2012: v0.5, r2791
------------------------------
1. Messages of the form "CQ DX K1ABC" are now supported.

November 30, 2012: v0.5, r2788
------------------------------
1. A bug was introduced when support for positive signal reports was
added.  It could cause a program crash when certain free-text messages
were composed for transmission.  The bug has been fixed.

2. In the slower JT9 sub-modes, the UTC listed on decoded text lines
has been changed to the start time of the Rx sequence, rather than the
time of the final minute.

3. The waterfall's "Auto Zero" button had no function, and has been
removed.

4. In previous revisions the installer put a number of DLLs into
the Windows system directory, normally C:\Windows\System32.  This
revision installs the DLLs to the WSJT-X installation directory.


November 29, 2012: v0.5, r2786
------------------------------
1. In r2783, the companion program jt9.exe (started automatically when
you start WSJT-X) was a CPU hog for no good reason.  This was an
oversight on my part, and the bug has been corrected.

2. The program should now run correctly if installed in a directory
whose name contains embedded spaces.  (Under Vista and Win7, however,
it's still not a good idea to install WSJT-X into C:\Program Files,
because of restricted write permissions there.)

3. In r2783 and earlier, stopping a transmission by toggling to "Auto
OFF" would terminate Tx audio and release PTT almost simultaneously,
possibly hot-switching your T/R relay(s).  This has been corrected so
that proper sequencing takes place.


November 28, 2012: v0.5, r2783
------------------------------
This revision has an unusually large number of changes relative to the
previous release, v0.4 r2746.  These changes include:

1. PTT control via COM ports COM10 and higher is enabled.

2. Improved decoder performance: higher speed as well as better
chances of success.  Moderate amounts of frequency drift are detected
and compensated.  Computed S/N values are more reliable.  Time offsets
from -2.5 to +5 s are now supported, which makes JT9 usable for EME.
(EME tests on 144 MHz have been successful, and performance on that
propagation mode appears to be good.)

3. Tx Frequency now tracks the selected QSO Frequency (unless you hold
down the CTRL key when setting QSO Frequency via mouse-clicks or the
F11/F12 keys).

4. Decoded text containing "CQ " is highlighted with green background;
text including "MyCall" is highlighted in red.

5. In previous versions, signal reports were required to be in the
range -30 to -01 dB.  In v0.5 r2782 the range has been extended to -50
to +49 dB.  There is backward compatibility for the range -30 to -01,
but reports in the range -50 to -31 and 0 to +49 will NOT be decoded
correctly by previous program versions.  It is important to upgrade!

6. Items "Save Synced" and "Save Decoded" are now implemented.

7. UTC Date, JT9 submode, and a parameter related to the decoding
procedure are now included in file wsjtx_rx.log.

8. Editing of Tx messages (in any of the six Tx message boxes) is
complete when you hit "Tab" or "Return".  The message is then parsed
and converted to the form in which it will be displayed if decoding is
successful.  Free-text messages are trimmed to 13 characters and
highlighted with a pink background.

9. The most recent transmitted message is displayed in the right-most
label on the status bar.  This can be useful if you have lost track of
where you were in a QSO.

10. By default, the program now starts with Monitor ON.  An option on
the Setup menu allows you to select "Monitor OFF at startup".

11. Better scaling is provided for the red "JT9 Sync" curve.  Note
that JT9 signals in the active sub-mode should appear in this plot as
a bump of width equal to the total signal bandwidth, with a narrow and
slightly higher bump at the left edge.  The narrow bump is the
frequency of the Sync tone, which is defined as the nominal frequency
of the JT9 signal.

12. Basic QSO information is now written to file wsjt.log when you
click the "Log QSO" button.

13. The WSJT-X User's Guide has been updated.

14. Other known bugs have been fixed.  There will probably be new
ones!  When you find one, or if you know of any old ones that have NOT
been fixed, please send me email.

Summary of Present Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I believe that WSJT-X is now a stable and very usable program.  Many
thousands of QSOs have been made with JT9-1, mostly at HF -- I have
made nearly 100, myself.  Also a number of QSOs have also been
completed at MF, and successful tests have been made on 2m EME, etc.
A number of QSOs have also been made with JT9-2.

As far as I know the slower modes (JT9-5, JT9-10, and JT9-30) also
work correctly.  (Certainly they do in my laboratory test setup.)
Most people will find these modes too slow for "everyday" use, and
they require high frequency stability.  It remains to be seen whether
they will be widely used.

An alternative approach to obtaining improved sensitivity would be to
give the decoder an ability to average over several successive
transmissions.  For example, the average of five JT9-1 transmissions
could reach a decoding threshold around -32 dB, only 2 dB worse than a
single JT9-5 transmission.  Because of QSB, the shorter transmissions
may actually succeed in less total time.  Stability requirements would
be those of JT9-1, much less stringent than those of JT9-5.

Program development is not finished, by any means.  I will be grateful
for your feedback on performance issues, as well as your "wish-list"
of features to be added.  As always, example recordings of files that
you think should have decoded, but did not, will be much appreciated.

November 16, 2012: v0.4, r2746
------------------------------

Changes from v0.4 r2731 include the following:

1. Valid signal reports are now generated by double-clicking on a
callsign in the decoded text window.

2. Consecutive spaces in a Tx message are now collapsed into a single
space.

3. Decoding speed is much improved, especially when strong (possibly
non-JT9) signals are present and "Tol" is set to a relatively large
value.

4. Scaling of the "JT9 Sync" plot (red curve) is more reasonable.

5. Layout of widgets on the main window has been improved.

6. Several minor bug fixes. 

November 14, 2012: v0.4, r2731
------------------------------

A number of known bugs have been fixed, and the JT9 decoder is
significantly improved.  Among other improvements, the program is now
much less fussy about timing issues.

November 6, 2012: v0.3, r2717
------------------------------

Changes from r2713 include the following:

1. A bug in the decoder that led to erratic behavior (failed decodes)
under certain conditions has been corrected.  Decoding is now much
more reliable.

2. A valid algorithm is now used to calculate S/N values for received
JT9 signals.

3. The header format of recorded *.wav files has been corrected.
These files will now play correctly in Windows programs that expect
the standard header.

November 6, 2012: v0.2, r2713
------------------------------

Changes from r2711 include the following:

1. Updates to the Quick-Start User's Guide,
http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT-X_Users_Guide.pdf

2. Double-click on waterfall now sets Tol to a reduced
(mode-dependent) value.

3. Tol is saved and restored on program restart.

4. A "digital gain" slider was added next to the green-bar audio level
indicator.  With the slider at mid-range, the scale reads correctly in
dB above the least significant bit of 16-bit audio data.

5. There is now a test that rejects at least one type of data that is
sufficiently corrupt to cause Eddie's best friend, the message
"15P6715P67WCV".

6. Several minor tweaks to improve decoder performance.

7. The program now starts with Monitor OFF.  You must click Monitor to
start accepting audio.  For some types of testing, this may be an
advantage.  This startup condition may be changed again, in the
future.

October 31, 2012: v0.2, r2711
-----------------------------

Three significant changes since r2706:

1. Three options are now provided on the "Decode" menu, controlling
the "depth" of the decoding process.  For most purposes I suggest you
should use "Normal", but feel free to experiment with the others.

2. Decoding of multiple signals in one Rx interval has been improved.

3. Handling of strong signals has been improved. 

October 309, 2012: v0.2, r2706
------------------------------

Changes since r2702 include the following:

1. The problem with "ghost" signals is fixed.

2. A problem causing very long decode times under certain
circumstances has been fixed.  Please note: decode times on any recent
PC should no more than a few seconds!

3. I have re-directed the program's fatal error messages so they will
be sent to the command-prompt window from which you started the
program. Please send me full reports on any such messages you observe,
preferably with details on how to reproduce the problem.

Some additional information ...

1. Yes, the JT9 modes require good stability in all system
oscillators.  The present JT9 bdecoder does not attempt to track
frequency drifts. Such capability will be added, however.  We have
been using digital modes for EME for nearly ten years now, at 144 MHz
and higher.  There are more than 1000 WSJT users on EME, using all
kinds of rige.  We have learned how to deal with reasonable rates of
drift.  Surely if we can do these things at VHF, we can do them much
more easily at MF and LF.

2. If you're sure that you have seen degraded JT9 performance because
of frequency stability issues, don't just complain on the LF
reflector. Document your case and send me an example file with a
drifting JT9 signal.  Making WSJT-X and JT9 better is partly YOUR
responsibility!

3. In other ways as well, test files are needed.  I can make many
tests myself, but I can't foresee all the problems others will have.
That's what the "Save All" function is for!  In these early tests,
always run with "Save All" checked, just in case you will want to
refer back to something that happened.  You may want to send me the
file in question.  You can always clean out your "Save" directory by
using "File | Delete all *.wav files in SaveDir".  I need good
examples of signals that fail to decode for any unknown reason.  Also
some good examples of atmospheric or other impulsive noise, for
testing the noise blanker.

4. I have added a page of "Hints for New Users" to the online WSJT-X
User's Guide,
http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT-X_Users_Guide.pdf .
Please read it! ... and let me know if you find other operational
details of WSJT-X that need explanation.  This will likely be
especially true for those not already familiar with older versions of
WSJT.

5. An operational suggestion: In many ways the different JT9 submodes
are treated as distinct modes.  If you receive a JT9-x signal in a
different submode than the one you have selected, you won't decode
it. For this reason, if JT9 is to become popular we'll probably need
to choose one or two of the submodes for general use, and perhaps
assign a narrow slice of the band to each one.  Note that "message
averaging" in the Rx software can make two or three JT9-2
transmissions as good as one JT9-5 transmission, with the advantage
that you will copy sooner if signals are better than required for
JT9-5.  Message averaging is not yet present in the JT9 decoder... but
in future it can be.  Again, we have dealt with such issues very
effectively on EME -- and can do so at MF/LF, for sure.

6. On the topic of CW, Beacons, WSPR, JT9, etc.  I really don't
understand what all the fuss is about.  Surely there is room for
everybody?  Maybe I'm just too new here to understand?  (Mal, is this
mostly just a matter of "Mal being Mal"???)

On the HF bands, the WSPR sub-band is just 200 Hz wide.  If we did the
same on 630 m, the WSPR sub-band would take up less than 3% of the 7
kHz band.  If that's too much, we could cut it in half, or even less,
and still have enough WSPR space.  Moreover, a "slow WSPR", if
warranted, would require even less bandwidth.  Similar comments apply
to JT9.  The bandwidth of JT9 signals is significantly less than that
of CW, for comparable information rates.  There should be enough
spectrum for both, even in our narrow MF and LF bands.

7. As for performance comparisons between JT9 and WSPR: WSPR is a
mature program, and its decoder has been optimized and tweaked over a
period approaching five years.  You are playing with JT9 in infancy.
With help (as opposed to simple complaints) from users, it will
improve rapidly.

October 29, 2012: v0.2, r2702
-----------------------------
Changes since version 0.1, r2696 include the following:

1. Sample rate for audio output has been changed from 12000 to 48000
Hz.  Tx audio may now be generated at any frequency from 500 to 20000
Hz.

2. The Decoder now tries to decode all synchronizable signals in the
"green zone", that is, within "Tol" Hz of the selected QSO
frequency. (Before, by default it decoded only the signal producing
the highest "sync" value.  Other signals could be decoded by manually
setting the QSO frequency and reducing Tol as needed.)

3. The user's selected QSO Frequency is now saved and restored on
program restart.

4. The problem with re-initialization after changing sub-modes has
been fixed.

5. The problem (for some users) of not releasing PTT after end of a
transmission has been fixed.

6. The program now writes a log of all decodes to a file wsjtx_rx.log
in the wsjtx directory.


October 25, 2012: v0.1, r2695
-----------------------------
Initial version of WSJT-X (experimental WSJT) released for testing.
