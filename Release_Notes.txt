                      Release: WSJT-X 2.7.0-rc7
                         September 30, 2024
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.7.0 Release Candidate 7 brings significant improvements for
the new SuperFox mode. It introduces a new verification system which
replaces the previous one, and works for both the SuperFox mode and
for old-style Fox and Hound operation. 
  
IMPORTANT: OpenSSL v1.1.1 or higher is now required.

Enhancements to the SuperFox decoder:

 - The performance of the SuperFox decoder has been further improved. 

 - Users can now set individual FTol values and tune the decoder to
   the exact sync frequency of the SuperFox signal if it is not exactly
   750 Hz. Both result in a better decodability in certain situations.

 - Important: The Rx frequency must now always be set to the sync 
   frequency +- FTol (i.e. usually to 750 +-50 Hz). 

Introduction of a new Fox verification system:

 - The new Fox verification system uses one time passwords (OTPs), and 
   works for the SuperFox mode as well as for old-style Fox and Hound 
   operation. It can be enabled by the new OTP checkbox on the Advanced
   tab of the Settings dialog.

 - Fox or SuperFox stations send individual OTPs via radio. Hounds 
   automatically check the validity of the received OTPs in real time 
   from a server when there is an internet connection. Otherwise, the 
   validity can also be queried manually later. OTP verifications can 
   only be retrieved once the transmission has already taken place.

 - Displaying the OTP verification messages can be switched off. 
   Verfication then runs fully automatically in the background.

 - If the verification was successful, the background color of the Hound 
   or Super Hound label switches to green.

 - Theoretically, DXpeditions can set up their own OTP server, however, 
   we recommend using the server at https://www.9dx.cc. 

 - Use of the new Fox verification system requires an OTP key. The system
   uses open source code and standard encryption technology. Non-verified
   SuperFox transmissions are now possible without a key.

Improvements to SuperFox/Hound operation:

 - SuperHounds must now first receive the SuperFox before they can call.
   A QSO can only be started by double-clicking on a SuperFox signal.
   Note that calling the Fox blindly not only leads to unnecessary band
   utilization, but can also significantly reduce the QSO rate due to
   unanswered (Super)Fox replies.

 - Switching to SuperHound mode automatically sets the Rx frequency to
   750 Hz. The previously selected frequency is saved and restored 
   afterwards.
 
 - Old-style Fox stations can now also transmit free text messages of
   up to 13 characters.

 - Some enhancements useful for Fox operators: Active Station Window now 
   shows band activity. Hound callsigns can be highlighted via UDP API, and 
   assigned a score for sorting via UDP API. Fox Tx frequency is preserved 
   when switching in/out of Fox mode.

 - UDP Status Update messages now include information on how many callsigns
   have highlighting applied, and how many callsigns have a score assigned.

Other enhancements and fixes:

 - In FT8 mode, the Settings dialog no longer resets the VFO frequency 
   to band/mode default unless really needed.

 - Fixed a flaw which resulted in sub-optimal QSO rates in SuperFox 
   mode.

 - Several code improvements for macOS.

 - Updated CTY.DAT and Hamlib.



                      Release: WSJT-X 2.7.0-rc6
                             July 19, 2024
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.7.0 Release Candidate 6 is a bug-fix release primarily
affecting the new SuperFox mode.  The following bugs have been fixed:

 - Strong signals from Superfox too frequently failed to decode.

 - SuperFox sometimes sent incorrect signal reports and an invalid
   digital signature.

 - A Fortran bounds error could sometimes occur in the SuperFox
   decoder.

 - For SuperFox operator, the "age" displayed for Hound callers
   became garbled after the 0000 UTC date change.

 - Decodes of SuperFox transmissions were not posted to PSK Reporter.

 - Some SuperFox-related  messages were posted incorrectly to ALL.TXT.

 - Logic for turning the SuperHound label green was flawed in some
   circumstances.

Release Candidate 6 also includes updates to Hamlib and the Chinese
user interface translation.

                      Release: WSJT-X 2.7.0-rc5
                             July 1, 2024
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.7.0 Release Candidate 5 introduces "SuperFox" mode, a
powerful new tool designed to help DXpeditions make digital QSOs at
very high rates. RC5 also brings several other improvements and bug
fixes.

SuperFox mode:

 - The SuperFox mode behaves operationally like the present Fox and
   Hounds mode but uses a constant envelope waveform for Fox's
   transmissions rather than sending concurrent streams of up to five
   normal FT8 signals. This approach means that up to 9 messages can
   be transmitted simultaneously with no signal-strength penalty,
   resulting in a system gain of about +10 dB compared to the
   conventional Fox/Hound operation with 5 slots.

 - IMPORTANT: Older revisions of WSJT-X and derivative programs will
   not be able to decode SuperFox transmissions. Hounds must use
   WSJT-X 2.7.0-rc5 (or a later release, when available) to receive
   SuperFox messages.

 - Hounds chasing the DX station will transmit normal FT8 signals, as
   in the old-style Fox and Hound mode.  QSOs will be logged as FT8
   mode.

 - When using SuperFox mode, Hound stations may call at any frequency
   in Fox's received passband, including the range 0 - 1000 Hz.
   Hounds do not QSY to a lower frequency for their final
   transmission.

 - SuperFox Operation requires the Fox operator to use a valid digital
   key.  Keys will be issued in advance to legitimate DXpeditions by
   the Northern California DX Foundation, and will be kept secret.

 - Every SuperFox transmission includes a unique digital signature.
   Hounds receiving a SuperFox message will see a "<callsign> verified"
   flag if the transmitted signature is valid, and the on-screen 
   "Super Hound" label will turn from red to green.

 - Hound operation should begin by selecting "Special operating
   activity", "Hound", and "SuperFox mode" on the Settings -> Advanced
   tab. Alternatively, right-clicking on the FT8 button toggles
   SuperFox mode on/off for either Fox or Hound, allowing quick
   transitions between SuperFox and old-style Fox and Hound operation.

 - SuperFox stations can send free text messages of up to 26 characters
   together with messages to as many as 4 Hounds.

Other enhancements:

 - Corrected a flaw that caused "Log automatically" to not work for
   the ARRL Digi Contest.

 - Control elements for special operating activities are now disabled
   (grayed out) if the respective function is not applicable.

 - Corrected a longstanding flaw that caused "Start new period
   decodes at top" to stop working properly after some time.

 - Right-click mouse press events are now less error-prone.

 - Improved the readability of the first line when "Start new period 
   decodes at top" is checked.

 - 4-digit grids are now logged for certain contest modes to ensure that 
   the log complies with contest rules.

 - The Fox Tx frequency is now saved and restored separately.


                      Release: WSJT-X 2.7.0-rc4
                           March 11, 2024
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.7.0 Release Candidate 4 brings some improvements for Fox-mode
operators, new features for companion program QMAP, and a number of
relatively minor enhancements and bug fixes.

QMAP enhancements -- of particular interest to EME operators:

 - QMAP now decodes Q65 submodes with both 60-second and 30-second T/R
   sequence lengths. Clicking on a resulting line in the WSJT-X Active
   Stations window automatically sets dial frequency and working
   submode as needed to call that station.

 - QMAP operates in 60-second receive sequences, and its Q65 decoder
   starts at t=19.5, 30.0, 49.5, and 58.5 s into the sequence.  Most
   decoded messages are displayed well before the end of the relevant
   time slot.

 - A new, more compact file format is now used for wideband data
   files.  A "Save decoded" option has been added to the Save menu.

 - An option has been added to allow exporting a 3 kHz portion of a
   wideband data file as a standard WSJT-X *.wav file.

 - CTRL+click on QMAP's upper waterfall sends an integer kHz dial
   frequency request to WSJT-X.

 - With focus on the WSJT-X main window, hit Alt+A on the keyboard to
   clear the Active Stations window.

 - Many minor enhancements to the User Interface.

WSJT-X:

 - Enable decoding of MSK144 from the jt9[.exe] executable.

 - Several changes to reduce problems experienced when (contrary to
   our recommendations) messages with short (10-bit) callsign hashes
   are used in standard FT4/FT8 sub-bands.

 - Enhancements useful for Fox operators.


                      Release: WSJT-X 2.7.0-rc3
                           January 1, 2024
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.7.0 Release Candidate 3 brings some new features, as well as 
numerous detail improvements and bug fixes, such as:

 - Added a new "Update Hamlib" function. On Windows, it allows the user to 
   update Hamlib directly from the program. The previously used version is 
   backed up, so the user can easily revert a hamlib update. 

 - The Hamlib version in use is now displayed (also on Linux and macOS).

 - The FT Roundup Messages protocol has been enhanced. It now allows also 
   the exchange of static 4-digit numbers instead of serial numbers. This 
   extends the usability of the FT RU protocol for other contest types.

 - Improved direct switching between modes. Submode, as well as the status 
   of the "Sh" and "Fast" checkboxes are now saved and restored by mode.

 - Some right-click events were made more intuitive and consistent. 
   - Right-clicking the Q65 button enables Q65 Pileup mode, a left-click 
     brings you back to the normal Q65 mode.
   - Right-click the JT65 button to switch to JT9 mode.

 - For Q65, all messages for us are now displayed in the right window.

 - Message averaging is now allowed only when VHF features are
   enabled, and label texts are changed to "Single Period Decodes" and
   "Average Decodes" only if averaging is enabled.

 - Some improvements to the Hamlib Transceiver code. Behavior is now
   more stable when Rig Split has been selected.

 - Prevented redundant network communication between WSJT-X and DX Lab 
   Suite Commander.

 - Download of the LotW file now works without OpenSSL libraries.

 - Made the spot counter work for WSPR.

 - Prevented insertion of an individual contest name when in Fox mode.

 - WAE entities are now assigned to the correct DXCC when "Include 
   extra WAE entities" is not selected.

 - Added a utility program 'cablog' which can be used to convert the
   wsjtx.log file to Cabrillo format for the ARRL EME contest.

 - Minor improvements to the Active Stations window.

 - The Rx/Tx frequency for Echo mode has been fixed at 1500 Hz.

 - Some corrections and updates to the INSTALL instructions for Linux.

 - Updated CTY.DAT file.

                      Release: WSJT-X 2.7.0-rc2
                             July 7, 2023
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.7.0 Release Candidate 2 introduces several minor improvements
and bug fixes.

 - CTRL+SHIFT+F11/F12 now changes dial frequency by 1000 Hz instead of
   2000 Hz.

 - Improved spotting to PSK Reporter for upcoming HamSCI Festivals of
   Eclipse Ionospheric Science.

 - Added optional Hungarian translation of the user interface.

 - Fixed a flaw that could produce false decodes in Q65 submodes D and E.

 - Fixed a flaw with the QSO start time. It is now reset when the DX 
   Call changes.

 - Fixed a flaw that prevented contest logging of the ARRL Digi Contest.

 - Right-clicking the Q65 mode button to toggle the Q65 Pileup mode on/off 
   now also works on macOS.

 - Fixed a compilation error on macOS Ventura.

 - WSPR and FST4W band hopping now works again.

 - It is now ensured that "U.S.A." is displayed when using certain 
   cty.dat files.

 - Corrected the problem with duplicated FT8 entries in ActiveStations 
   window.

                      Release: WSJT-X 2.7.0-rc1
                             May 12, 2023
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.7.0 Release Candidate 1 introduces a new program called QMAP,
a new Special Operating Activity known as Q65 Pileup, and a number of
other enhancements and fixes.

 - QMAP and Q65 Pileup mode are of particular interest to those
   engaged in Earth-Moon-Earth (EME) communication, but other
   applications may be found for them as well.

   - QMAP is derived from MAP65, an older program used since 2007 for
     EME, mainly on the 2 m band. QMAP provides single-polarization
     receive-only capabilities for any one of the 60-second submodes
     of Q65. It allows you to monitor all traffic in a 90 kHz subband
     while conducting EME QSOs in the usual way with WSJT-X.

   - Q65 Pileup mode is a new feature in WSJT-X that will assist DX
     operators using Q65 in pileup circumstances with many
     simultaneous callers and very weak signals, such as those
     experienced by 6-meter EME DXpeditions.

   - Further details on QMAP and Q65 Pileup mode are available in a
     Quick-Start guide posted here:
     https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/Quick_Start_WSJT-X_2.7_QMAP.pdf

 - WSJT-X now provides more efficient spotting to PSK Reporter.
   Redundant spots are omitted, and posting of spots is now spread
   more widely in time. (Temporarily, in support of the HamSCI
   Festivals of Eclipse Ionospheric Science, spots will be transmitted
   more frequently during the upcoming solar eclipses.)

 - WSJT-X is now able to process more than 100 FT8 decodes in a single
   reception interval.

 - Improvements to the Fox mode:
   - More convenient and efficient handling of the two queues.
   - Fox Log window now displays statistical data on the QSO rate.

 - When the station locator is changed (e.g during portable
   operations), the new locator will be sent automatically to PSK
   Reporter.

 - The cty.dat file can now be updated by clicking a button on the
   Settings -> Colors tab.

 - A new status display appears when fetching a new LotW file.

 - Multi-streamed messages transmitted by MSHV are now handled
   properly when WSJT-X is in Hound mode.

 - Auto-sequencing now has better protection against unwanted effects
   caused by late FT8 decodes.

 - Fixed an inconsistency in which Contest Name was not correctly
   remembered.

 - Other minor bug fixes.

 - Updated hyperlinks to our homepage and to our new WSJT GROUP User
   Forum (https://groups.io/g/wsjtgroup/) can now also be found in the
   User Guide.

 - The build instructions for macOS have been clarified.


                        Release: WSJT-X 2.6.1
                           January 16, 2023
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.6.1 is mostly a bug fix release for Q65.  It has the following  
changes since release 2.6.0:

 - Fix a flaw in Q65 mode that prevented proper display of the T/R 
   period spinner.

 - Make the initialization of the decoded text font more robust.

 - Better initialization when starting the program in FT8 Hound mode.

 - Fix a bug causing program crash with more than 100 decodes in a
   single FT8 sequence.

 - Fix a compiler warning on macOS.

 - Correct the reference to "ARRL International Digital Contest" in the 
   Release Notes.

                        Release: WSJT-X 2.6.0
                           January 6, 2023
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.6.0 is a General Availability (GA) release, the first since
version 2.5.4.  Its major enhancements include the following:

 - Mode selection buttons on main window for FT4, FT8, JT65, MSK144, 
   Q65, and FT8's Hound mode 
 - Support for the ARRL International Digital Contest
 - Performance enhancements for the FT8 and Q65 modes
 - New features for EME Echo mode, including calibrated SNR reports
 - Several new convenience features for Fox operators 
 - Save/Restore capability, "Preferred" status, and effective date
   ranges for mode-dependent tables of default frequencies
 - Improved display features for contest log
 - Improved calibration of SNR estimates for modes FST4 and FST4W

Other enhancements and bug fixes since 2.6.0-rc5 include the following:

 - PSK Reporter spotting is now also possible for frequencies > 4 GHz. 
   This is required for QO-100, for example.

 - The minimum width of the main window has been further reduced, and 
   such small sizes are now remembered and properly restored.

 - Some further improvements for Fox operators.

 - Fix the long-standing flaw that "Start new period decodes at top" 
   didn't work anymore after several hours.

 - Fix a flaw that could cause crashes by double-clicking messages 
   with <...> in certain QSO situations.

 - Fix a flaw that prevented the rig from initializing correctly after 
   switching between configurations when connected via HRD.

 - Add tooltips to better explain the split operation options.

 - Add some additional FT roundup exchanges which can be used for 
   local contests or QSO parties.

 - Add an option to call CQ with an individual contest name.

 - Update of some ARRL section abbreviations.

For full details on changes since WSJT-X version 2.5.4, be sure to
read the Release Notes sections for 2.6.0-rc1 through rc5, immediately
following.


                      Release: WSJT-X 2.6.0-rc5
                          November 29, 2022
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.6.0 Release Candidate 5 brings a number of improvements as
well as some bug fixes.

In program WSJT-X:

 - Better calibration for FST4/W SNR estimates.

 - Upload FST4W-900 spots to wsprnet with TR code 15 instead of 16.

 - Improved FT8 decoding on crowded bands. 

 - The Working frequency table now offers the following options:
   - Better handling of more than one frequency per band.
   - Set your preferred frequencies, WSJT-X always comes back to these
     QRGs when changing band or mode.
   - You can label your frequencies with descriptions (e.g. DXp AB0YXZ).
   - Option to set Start and End Date/Time, so that the frequencies 
     automatically appear and disappear. Useful for contest or 
     DXpedition QRGs.
   - Load a frequency table from a file to easily get all such data 
     implemented.

 - In Fox mode, there are now a few additional functions that allow 
   operators to react even better to different QSO situations:
   - A new two-column table in Tab 2 provides a better overview of 
     the queue and of the callsigns with QSOs in progress.
   - Fox operator can now change the ordering of callsigns in the
     queue so that he can react if there is only a narrow time slot
     for a particular QSO due to propagation.
   - Fox now responds for another two cycles to stations whose 
     report was not received, increasing the success rate for a
     difficult QSO.

 - Correct a flaw in Hound mode that sometimes prevented completion of
   QSOs with non-standard calls.

 - Improvements to EME Echo mode:
   - New control "Avg" sets the number of Echo cycles to be averaged.
   - New capability to display measurements of wideband noise power as
     a function of time.  This can be useful for measuring Sun noise,
     antenna tracking errors, and the like.
   - Several minor bug fixes

 - Correct a flaw that prevented WSJT-X from always initializing 
   correctly when special operating activities were enabled.

 - Correct a flaw that caused wrong Tx frequencies to be written to  
   ALL.TXT.

 - The GUI has been improved regarding some details. The controls now 
   scale better at different font sizes and on different operating 
   systems.

 - When in Hound mode and click the "H" button again, the frequency 
   is now kept. This gives the user the following two options to return 
   to normal FT8 mode:
    - Click the "H" button again. Then you will stay on the QRG.
    - Click the "FT8" button (or use the Settings menu). It brings  
      you back to the default FT8 QRG.

 - Decodes flagged as 'a7' are now disabled when "Enable AP" is not
   checked, and during the first period after a band change.

 - The network address of the UDP server is now checked for errors  
   before being accepted.

 - Some improvements to the DX Lab Suite Commander interface. 

 - Correct some possible flaws that could cause segfault errors in 
   certain unusual situations.

 - Warnings on dropped audio have been disabled for now, as detection  
   has turned out to be not reliable enough.

 - Correct a long-standing flaw which caused the "Transmit digital gain" 
   overlay to appear somewhere on the screen.

 - "Highlight DX Call" now also works when the other station is <...>.

 - CQ messages without a grid are now sent to PSK reporter.

 - Several other minor corrections (tool tips, etc.). 

Program MAP65 (Windows only) includes several minor bug fixes and two 
tentative new features:
 - an aid for measuring antenna pointing errors
 - an ability to read the file wsjtx.log (kept by WSJT-X) to recognize
   EME contest dupes.


                      Release: WSJT-X 2.6.0-rc4
                          September 8, 2022
                      -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.6.0 Release Candidate 4 provides further improvements to Echo 
mode, a new File menu item, and several bug fixes.

 - New features and fixes for Echo mode
   - Created a new simulator echosim[.exe]
   - Improved organization of output to text window
   - Gain and Zero controls in Echo Graph now behave independently
   - "Clear Avg" now erases the plot in Echo Graph
   - Optional baseline for plots in Echo Graph

 - New menu item "File | Copy main text window to WSJT-X.txt"
 - Doppler tracking checkbox is made sticky

 - Fix an RC2 bug that prevented normal use of JT9.
 - Fix a rarely experienced failure when writing to decoded.txt
 - Fix a hamlib bug caused by setting VFO B when Split is not used
 - Rig control interface to Ham Radio deluxe made more robust 


	        Release: WSJT-X 2.6.0-rc3
	             August 22, 2022
	        ----------------------

WSJT-X 2.6.0 Release Candidate 3 provides improvements to Echo mode and
several bug fixes.

 - Echo mode now allows audio-frequency corrections rather than
   CAT-controlled resetting of dial frequency for Doppler corrections,
   when Doppler shift is less than 750 Hz.  Audio-frequency
   corrections are also used to correct any remaining portion of
   Doppler shift caused by coarse CAT-controlled frequency setting.

 - Echo mode now saves .wav files when "Save all" is selected.  When
   such files are opened in Echo mode, the astronomical parameters at
   recording time are restored and used for processing the Echo data.

 - A missing Leap Second (January 1, 2017) was added to the code that
   converts UTC to UT1.  This detail might matter if you want full
   accuracy EME Doppler corrections.

 - EME Doppler values are now rounded to nearest integer Hz.

 - For backward compatibility, "Special Operating Activity"
   enumerations for Fox and Hound modes are reset to their previous
   values 6 and 7.

 - Allow FST4W transmissions on 30m band.  Ensure that correct
   frequency is reported to WSPRnet for FST4W decodes with Rx Freq
   spinbox not set to 1500.

 - Fix a bug that could truncate WSPR transmissions early.

 - Fix a bug that occasionally caused a crash when 'decoded.txt'
   could not be opened.

 - Fix a bug that could cause a crash if Astronomical Data window
   is not active when needed.

 - Fix a bug that caused a crash when "Reset Cabrillo Log" is
   selected with Active Stations window not active. 


	        Release: WSJT-X 2.6.0-rc2
	             July 21, 2022
	        ----------------------

WSJT-X 2.6.0 Release Candidate 2 brings a number of improvements as
well as some bug fixes.

 - The "Measure" function in Echo mode now uses the computed Doppler
   spread for DX grid, when available.  This feature is especially
   helpful for microwave EME tests, enabling accurate measurement of
   SNR for a DX station.

 - Settings for T/R period and Submode are now remembered by mode when
   you switch directly between (for example) MSK144-15, Q65-60A,
   JT65C, or FST4-120.

 - Tx and Rx audio frequencies are remembered and restored when you
   return from a mode that sets a default frequency of 1500 Hz
   (MSK144, FST4W, Echo, WSPR, FreqCal) and then switching back to
   FT4, FT8, Q65, JT65, or FST4.

	        Release: WSJT-X 2.5.4
	             Dec 28, 2021
	        ----------------------

This is mostly a bug fix  release.  It has the following changes since
release 2.5.3:

WSJTX:
 - Repair a defect that caused occasional crashes when in QSO with 
   stations using nonstandard callsigns.

MAP65:
 - Allowing MAP65 "Best-fit Delta phi" solution to be displayed to the
   user.


	        Release: WSJT-X 2.5.3
	             Dec 7, 2021
	        ----------------------

This release has the following changes since release 2.5.2:

 - Add a note in memory of G4WJS to the About window

 - Add a simple $DXCALL macro capability for Tx messages, and update
   the User Guide accordingly

 - Ensure that MAIN VFO is used for receiving on rigs that require it
 
 - Repair a defect in reporting low-confidence decodes to PskReporter

 - Updated CTY.DAT database, tnx to Jim AD1C


	        Release: WSJT-X 2.5.2
	             Nov 4, 2021
	        ----------------------

This is mostly a bug fix  release.  It has the following changes since
release 2.5.1:

 - Repair a  longstanding regression  that caused signal  reports from
   tail-ended Tx2 messages to be omitted from logged information

 - Parse   "dx-call-1 RR73; dx-call-2 <de-call> +nn"  messages  (i3=0,
   n3=1 DXpedition mode) in regular 77-bit modes

 - Repair a regression  associated with setting the  main window width
   on program startup.

 - Repair a problem with Q65 decodes  of type 'q3' for messages of the
   form "<Call_1> Call_2"

 - Execute code associated with Q65 decodes of type 'q5' only when the
   Max   Drift   control   is   set  to   50.    This   fix   prevents
   double-incrementing of  the message averaging counter  on the first
   decoding sequence.

 - Polarization offset 'Dpol' from the astronomical data window is now
   written    to    file     azel.dat    if    environment    variable
   WSJT_AZEL_EXTRA_LINES has  been defined as  1 or greater.   Dpol is
   especially useful for EME on the higher microwave bands.

 - The Auto  Log QSO option  in "Settings->Reporting" now  behaves the
   same  as  the Prompt  to  log  QSO option  when  not  in a  special
   operating context mode.

 - The Fast/Normal/Deep  setting in  Q65 mode is  now a sticky setting
   and is no longer reset to Fast on program startup or  when Settings
   has  been opened. The user selection is used for automatic decodes,
   but Deep is used for any subsequent manual decode attempts.

 - New hamlib code to correct minor flaws in controlling several rigs.

 - Update  the  Chinese  and  Hong   Kong  translations  of  the  user
   interface.

 - Note  that since  the WSJT-X  v2.5.0 GA  release we  have not  been
   providing pre-built 32-bit  packages for Linux on  Intel CPUs, this
   is  due to  the mainstream  Linux Desktop  distributions no  longer
   providing updates for 32-bit only  systems. 32-bit WSJT-X can still
   be  built for  Linux Intel  and is  supported at  least until  some
   prerequisite package is no longer available.

to Q65 and JT65 modes when used with non-standard and compound
calls. Also included is a new feature for microwave aircraft scatter
and repairs for defects detected since the 2.5.0 GA release.

 - Improved Q65 support for 10GHz Aircraft Scatter contributed by Rex,
   VK7MO, and Roger, W3SZ. (See "10 GHz Terrestrial with Q65" in DUBUS
   Vol 1/2021 page 64.)  Decodes of type 'q3' may now include
   corrections for frequency drift.

   decodes of messages containing a non-standard call.

 - Repair the logic that sets parameters for Q65 "Deep" decoding.

 - In Q65 mode, allow 'q2' decodes when MyCall is compound or
   non-standard.

 - Repair a long-standing defect that could cause a crash when
   reference spectrum correction is enabled.

 - Updated UI translations from Xavi, EA3W, Oba-san, JA7UDE, and a new
   translation for Traditional Chinese by Steven, BU2EL.

   that frequency with full "q3" sensitivity.

 - Use new ADIF recommendations for Q65: mode=MFSK, submode=Q65.

 - If "Single decode" is unchecked, look for Q65 decodes from
   accumulated average even after obtaining a single-sequence
   decode at selected Rx Freq.

 - For data read from .wav files, display the original UTC (derived
   from file name) on the waterfall instead of current UTC.

		   Release: WSJT-X 2.3.1
		        Mar 26, 2021
		   ---------------------

WSJT-X 2.3.1  General Availability release  updates the User  Guide to
cover the  new modes FST4 and  FST4W along with sample  .WAV files and
decoding tutorials. This release also  repairs a number of defects and
regressions  discovered  since  the v2.3.0  release,  including  those
below.

 - When  sending traffic  to a  multicast UDP  server ensure  that the
   local loop-back interface is used if no others are selected.

 - Repair  a defect  in instance  lock  file handling  that causes  an
   infinite loop on start up.

 - Invert the  PTT serial port  sharing default behaviour,  and enable
   sharing when non-Hamlib CAT control  is combined with direct serial
   port PTT control.

 - Allow  the FST4  and FST4W  decoders  to continue  after the  first
   successful decode when using negative  NB values to try multiple NB
   values.

 - Repair defects in auto-sequencing,  particularly with responding to
   a repeated final message. In general a double-click of the repeated
   message now does the right thing.

 - Repair a regression that had  inadvertently disabled EU VHF Contest
   mode when using the MSK144 mode.

 - Repair a defect  that could caused incorrect log  entry fields when
   using FT4 mode and a priori (AP) decoding.

 - Repair defects saving .WAV files for periods with decodes.

 - Offer a new scheme for adjusting macOS shared memory parameters.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.4.0-rc1
		         Feb 3, 2021
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.4.0 is  a program upgrade offering a new  mode called Q65. It
builds on the capabilities of the QRA64 mode to offer a flexible large
symbol alphabet,  low code  rate, mode with  excellent characteristics
when  used  for EME  on  VHF  through  to  microwave bands,  and  with
challenging weak  signal propagation  via iono-scatter and  similar on
VHF bands. The Q65 mode carries the same 77-bit message payload as the
popular FT8, MSK144, FT4, and FST4  QSO modes. Q65 also offers a range
of T/R periods (15 second through to  5 mins) and tone spacings (up to
32  times  the  base  spacing)   suitable  for  adapting  to  required
sensitivity and  various channel frequency  spreading characteristics.
The Wide Graph plotter  has a super-sensitive synchronization spectrum
capable of detecting  signals below visibility on  the waterfall plot.
The new synchronization plot combined with comprehensive a priori (AP)
decoding techniques and message summing and averaging over multiple Rx
periods  should  make use  near  the  limits  of extreme  weak  signal
operating better than prior modes in all appropriate situations.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.3.0
		         Feb 2, 2021
		   ---------------------

WSJT-X 2.3.0 General Availability release  adds the new modes FST4 and
FST4W along with many defect repairs.  See summaries below and for the
prior release candidates (2.3.0-rc1 through  -rc4) of this version for
details.

 - FST4/W: Disable envelope  shaping at start and  end of transmission
   when environment variable FST4_NOSHAPING=1. Works for fst4sim too.

 - Add time stamp to error message boxes to aid diagnosis.

 - Repair a defect that caused crashes  at start up for some macOS Big
   Sur users.

 - Repair a defect that could cause  the jt9 slow mode decoder process
   to exit incorrectly with a failure status.

 - Updated CTY.DAT file.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.3.0-rc4
		         Jan 26, 2021
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X  2.3.0 Release  Candidate 4  is a  stop-gap release  while some
recent important Hamlib changes are  being verified. Also included are
the following regression and defect repairs.

 - The wsprd command line tool  uses the current working directory for
   the data file directory if it is not specified.

 - Updates to the language translations of the WSJT-X user Interface.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.3.0-rc3
		         Jan 6, 2021
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.3.0  Release Candidate 3  adds an improved FST4W  decoder and
fixes  several defects  and  regressions discovered  since the  second
release candidate.

 - FST4W:  Improve FST4W  decoder sensitivity  on fading  channels and
   decrease false  decode rate.

   FST4W  uses  50-bit   messages  and  a  24-bit   CRC.   The  74-bit
   message+CRC is  encoded into a 240-bit  codeword. Received messages
   are decoded by  two different decoders: (i)  a “belief propagation”
   (BP)  decoder and  (ii) an  ordered statistics  decoder (OSD).  The
   ordered statistics  decoder has a knob  that allows any or  all CRC
   bits to be treated as additional parity bits rather than as part of
   the  message+CRC  field.  Thus,  the OSD  decoder  can  decode  the
   received message  as a  (240,50+Nc) code, where  Nc is  any integer
   between 0  and 24.  In  the RC1 and  RC2 releases the  OSD decoding
   attempt  treated the  code as  a (240,64)  code (14-bit  CRC). This
   release uses 2  OSD decoding attempts that treat  the received word
   as (i) a (240,66) code with 16-bit CRC and code rate 0.308 and (ii)
   a (240,50) code with no CRC and code rate 0.208. Codewords returned
   by  the (240,50)  CRC-less decoding  attempt are  unpacked and  the
   decode is  printed only  if it contains  a callsign/grid  pair that
   have  been previously  decoded  by the  belief propagation  decoder
   (which treats the  code as a (240,74) code with  24-bit CRC) or the
   ordered   statistics  decoder   configured  for   (240,66)  (16-bit
   CRC). The callsign/grid memory  is stored in file “fst4w_calls.txt”
   which resides in the data directory.

 - FT8: Fixed a crash triggered by double clicking on the waterfall to
   invoke a decode of a signal in the preceding T/R interval.

		   Release: WSJT-X 2.3.0-rc2
		         Nov 16, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X  2.3.0  Release Candidate  2  fixes  issues  found in  RC1  and
includes some new functionality that missed the RC1 cut off deadline.

 - Dropped audio samples message box  removed, warnings and errors for
   these are now sent to the WSJT-X system log.

 - FST4W spots to  WSPRNet.org will be augmented such  that the server
   can distinguish the  mode being spotted. Spots  to WSPRNet.org will
   no longer be restricted to WSPR sub-bands.

 - A new  internal system  and data logging  facility used  to provide
   trace,  debug,   information,  warning,  error,  and   fatal  error
   messages. The verbosity and filtering of messages is user definable
   via a configuration file. Without  a configuration file a basic log
   is written with  information, warning and error  messages only. Log
   files are automatically rotated to limit disk usage.

 - Due to  some users using  inappropriate multicast IP  addresses for
   their interoperating  severs the default  behaviour now is  to only
   send multicast  UDP datagrams  to the loop-back  network interface.
   Users who  require WSJT-X UDP  Message Protocol datagrams  to reach
   other  hosts will  now  have  to configure  WSJT-X  to  send on  an
   appropriate  network interface,  and  use  an appropriately  scoped
   multicast group address for their  server applications.  If you are
   not sure then  224.0.0.1 (or ff02::1 if IPv6 is  desired) is a safe
   choice.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.3.0-rc1
		         Sept 28, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X  2.3.0 is  a program  upgrade offering  two new  modes designed
especially for use  on the LF and  MF bands.  FST4 is  for 2-way QSOs,
and FST4W is for WSPR-like transmissions.  Both modes offer a range of
options for T/R sequence  lengths and threshold decoding sensitivities
extending well  into the -40 dB  range.  Early tests have  shown these
modes frequently spanning intercontinental distances on the 2200 m and
630 m bands.  Further details and  operating hints can be found in the
"Quick-Start Guide to FST4 and FST4W", posted on the WSJT web site:

https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/FST4_Quick_Start.pdf

WSJT-X 2.3.0-rc1  is a  beta-quality release  candidate for  a program
upgrade  that provides  a number  of new  features, capabilities,  and
defect repairs.  These include:

 - New modes FST4 and FST4W targeting LF and MF bands.

 - Improved noise baseline discovery for more reliable SNR estimates.

 - On the waterfall and 2D spectrum a tool-tip shows the frequency
   offset under the mouse pointer.

 - The *On Dx Echo* Doppler compensation method has been modified in
   response to feedback from Users. Basic functionality is unchanged.
   See the User Guide (Section 8.1) for more information.

 - Improved user_hardware script or program initiation for WSPR
   band-hopping mode.

 - Decoded  QSO  mode  message   display  narrowed  to  make  appended
   information easier to view without scrolling the window.

 - Option to record the propagation mode in logged QSO records.

 - ADIF v3.1.1 compliance.

 - Option to connect to PSKReporter using TCP/IP for those with very
   poor Internet connections.

 - Major rewrite of the PSKReporter interface to improve efficiency
   and reduce traffic levels.

 - Removal of the Tab 2 generated messages.

 - Accessibility improvements to the UI.

 - Tweaked decode speed options for a better user experience with
   lower powered single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi.

 - Updates to UI translations in Spanish, Italian, Catalan, Chinese,
   Hong Kong Chinese, Danish, and Japanese.

 - Audio devices only enumerated when starting up and opening the
   "Settings->Audio" device lists.

 - Option to select the default audio device removed to minimize the
   likelihood of system sounds being transmitted.

 - Better handling of missing audio devices.

 - Improved and enhanced meta-data saved to .WAV files.

 - Many other defects repaired.


		  Release: WSJT-X 2.2.2
		       June 22, 2020
		  ---------------------

WSJT-X v2.2.2 is a bug fix release, mainly to incorporate the new RAC
section PE into the FT8/FT4/MSK144 Contest Mode for Field Day.

 - Stations intending to operate in Field Day (FD) are urged to
   upgrade to this release, without it you cannot set your section to
   PE, and of equal importance you cannot decode contest messages from
   stations who are operating from PE without this upgrade.

 - FT8 decoder speeded up in Normal and Fast modes. This change gives
   a speed of decoding closer to that of v2.1.2 without compromising
   the number of decodes. It is particularly targeted for slower
   single board computer users such as the Raspberry Pi Model 3 or
   similar.

 - Thanks to our user interface language translation contributors for
   many improvements to the translated strings.

 - The DX Grid field is now cleared automatically when the DX Call
   field is changed. Care should be taken to complete entry of a
   callsign before entering a grid square.


		  Release: WSJT-X 2.2.1
		       June 6, 2020
		  ---------------------

WSJT-X v2.2.1 is a bug fix release that fixes regressions found in the
prior v2.2.0 release. Here is a brief summary;

 - Incorporate a revised Hamlib version the address a regression in
   rig control of some rigs including the Yaesu FT-991 and FT-891.

 - Repair a defect in 6 character gridsquare lookup from the CALL3.TXT
   database, and improve "Lookup" button processing.

 - Repair a defect with selecting Wide Graph 2D spectrum types in
   translated UIs.

 - Repair a regression that blocked the Highlight Callsign UDP request
   from highlighting terms including a '+' character.

 - Repair a defect that caused hash code lookups of one's own call to
   fail after an extended period of inactivity, when operating with a
   non-standard callsign.

 - Repair  a  regression  where   occasional  Highlight  Callsign  UDP
   requests with the 'Highlight last'  parameter as true highlighted a
   match in a prior period. This fix include a performance improvement
   when  processing any  Highlight  Callsign  request with  'Highlight
   last' as true.

 - Include support for the Yaesu FT-920 when controlled by Ham Radio
   Deluxe. This change inadvertently missed the v2.2.0 GA release.

 - Correct a documentation issue with the UDP Message Protocol
   Status(1) message Special Operations Mode enumeration values ("WW
   DIGI added", Fox, and Hound renumbered). Thanks to Sam, W2JDB, for
   raising this issue.

 - Updated Catalan UI translation, tnx Xavi, EA3W.

 - Italian UI translation, tnx Marco, PY1ZRJ.

 - Updated Spanish UI translation, tnx Cédric, EA4AC. 


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.2
		       June 2, 2020
		   -------------------

WSJT-X 2.2 is a program upgrade that provides a number of new features
and capabilities.  Here is a brief summary; for further details see
the notes for candidate releases 2.2.0-rc1, -rc2, and -rc3, below, and
of course the updated WSJT-X 2.2 User Guide.

 - Significant improvements to the decoders for FT4, FT8, JT4, JT65,
   and WSPR.

 - New format for "EU VHF Contest" Tx2 and Tx3 messages

   When "EU VHF Contest" is selected, the Tx2 and Tx3 messages (those  
   conveying signal report, serial number, and 6-character locator)
   now use hashcodes for both callsigns.  This change is NOT backward
   compatible with earlier versions of _WSJT-X_, so all users of EU
   VHF Contest messages should be sure to upgrade to version 2.2.0.

 - Accessibility

   Keyboard shortcuts have been added as an aid to accessibility:
   Alt+R sets Tx4 message to RR73, Ctrl+R sets it to RRR.

   As an aid for partial color-blindness, the "inverted goal posts"
   marking Rx frequency on the Wide Graph's frequency scale are now
   rendered in a darker shade of green.

 - User Interface Translations have been enabled.  Translations are
   now available for Catalan, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Hong
   Kong Chinese.  Additiional languages will follow, when available.

   Note that UI translation is automatic, based on your system primary
   language. If you do not want the WSJT-X UI translated to your local
   language then start WSJT-X with the '--language=en' command line
   option:

   wsjtx --language=en

   If you wish to contribute by authoring WSJT-X UI translations
   please join the new discussion group wsjtx-l10n@Groups.io
   (https://groups.io/g/wsjtx-l10n), where help from other translation
   authors and coordination with the development team is available.

 - Minor enhancements and bug fixes

   "Save None" now writes no .wav files to disk, even temporarily.

   An explicit entry for "WW Digi Contest" has been added to
   "Special operating activities" on the "Settings | Advanced" tab.

   Contest mode FT4 now always uses RR73 for the Tx4 message.

   The Status bar now displays the number of decodes found in the
   most recent Rx sequence.

   The "Highlight Callsign" UDP message has been enhanced to allow
   clearing of old highlighting for a specified callsign. Please note
   a recommended restriction on the use of this message in the
   documentation here: https://tinyurl.com/y85nc3tg

 - Hamlib - this library which we use for direct rig control has had
   many defect repairs and enhancements, we thank the contributors to
   that project for their work.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc3
		          May 29, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc3 is the third release candidate for WSJT-X 2.2.0.

The most important differences from the -rc2 version are the
correction of regressions in hamlib code that affected particular
radios and PTT keying by means of DTR or RTS on a COM port.

In addition, RC3 has the following enhancements and minor bug fixes:

 - Updates to Catalan translation of the UI (thanks to EA3W)
 - Spanish translation of the UI (EA3W)
 - Load language translations only when matching primary language
 - Minor corrections to User Guide
 - Increased FT8 sync threshold in "Normal" and "Fast" decoding
 - Corrected the code that restores the WideGraph, EchoGraph, and
   FastGraph windows to normal view after they have been minimized.
 - Don't allow restart with "ISCAT B" mode label unless VHF features
   are enabled.
 - Repair regression defect in WSPR power combo box items


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc2
		          May 25, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc2 is a release candidate for WSJT-X 2.2.0.  The
following bugs present in the -rc1 version have been fixed:

 - Missing blank line between some decode sequences.
 - Improper functioning of "Start new period decodes at top".
 - Font selection caused crash on some macOS systems.
 - Mouse action in band selector box not right in some macOS systems.
 - Incorrect recall of Tx power setting in WSPR mode.
 - Many fixes to hamlib library and executables (rigctld, etc.).
 - Some regional settings did not allow WSJT-X to start.
 - Main window "looked like old Windows" in macOS.
 - Crash when "Ref Spec" is selected and no refspec.dat available.
 - Improper decoding of some FT4 messages with hashed "MyCall".
 - Crash after warning message about double-clicking in ISCAT mode.

In addition, we have made the following improvements:

 - Updated some figures and text in User Guide.
 - Corrected some formatting issues in the pdf version of User Guide.
 - Added some new sample files.
 - Improved shape and position of "green goal post" in Wide Graph.
 - Significantly reduced the rate of false decodes in FT4 and FT8.
 - Allow FT4 to use NA VHF Contest message formats.
 - Hold Tx frequency no longer cleared when switching between modes.
 - Added capability for translations of the user interface into
   languages other than English.  First working example (special
   thanks to Xavi Perez, EA3W!), is Catalan.  Spanish will be next.
 - Performance improvements to decode highlighting via UDP messages.

And finally:

Increasing FT8 usage on the popular bands 40, 30, and 20m means that
the default 3 kHz sub-bands are often wall-to-wall with signals.
Overcrowding encourages some to turn on their amplifiers, which only
makes things worse.  We are trying to coordinate the suggested
frequencies in WSJT-X with updated band plans being considered by
IARU, ARRL, and other amateur radio societies.

On a trial basis, and in response to numerous suggestions from around
the world, we have added a second set of suggested dial frequencies
for FT8 on three HF bands and also on 6 meters. The new suggested dial
frequencies are 7.071, 10.133, 14.071, and 50.310 MHz.  These
frequencies will appear in your drop-down band-selector list after you
go to the "Settings | Frequencies" tab, right-click on the frequency
table, and select "Reset".  Alternatively, you can add the new FT8
frequencies manually.

When the conventional FT8 sub-band on 6, 20, 30, or 40 m seems too
full, please try moving your dial frequency down 3 kHz!  Be aware that
as currently implemented, WSJT-X will set your dial to the lowest
frequency for the selected mode and band, when you switch bands.

See the next section for a list of other program improvements since
WSJT-X 2.1.2.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc1
		          May 10, 2020
		   -------------------------

WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc1 is a beta-quality release candidate for a program
upgrade that provides a number of new features and capabilities.  These
include:

  - Improvements to the decoders for five modes:
 
      FT4: Corrected bugs that prevented AP decoding and/or multi-pass
      decoding in some circumstances.  The algorithm for AP
      decoding has been improved and extended.

      FT8: Decoding is now spread over three intervals.  The first
      starts at t = 11.8 s into an Rx sequence and typically yields
      around 85% of the possible decodes for the sequence.  You
      therefore see most decodes much earlier than before.  A second
      processing step starts at 13.5 s, and the final one at 14.7 s.
      Overall decoding yield on crowded bands is improved by 10% or
      more.  (Systems with receive latency greater than 0.2 s will see
      smaller improvements, but will still see many decodes earlier
      than before.)

      JT4: Formatting and display of Averaged and Deep Search decodes
      has been cleaned up and made consistent with other modes.
      Together with JT65 and QRA64, JT4 remains one of the digital
      modes widely for EME and other extreme weak-signal work on
      microwave bands.

      JT65: Many improvements for Averaged and Deep Search decodes and
      their display to the user.  These improvements are particularly
      important for EME on VHF and UHF bands.

      WSPR: Significant improvements have been made to the WSPR
      decoder's sensitivity, its ability to cope with many signals in
      a crowded sub-band, and its rate of undetected false decodes.
      We now use up to three decoding passes.  Passes 1 and 2 use
      noncoherent demodulation of single symbols and allow for
      frequency drifts up to ±4 Hz in a transmission.  Pass 3 assumes
      no drift and does coherent block detection of up to three
      symbols.  It also applies bit-by-bit normalization of the
      single-symbol bit metrics, a technique that has proven helpful
      for signals corrupted by artifacts of the subtraction of
      stronger signals and also for LF/MF signals heavily contaminated
      by lightning transients.  With these improvements the number of
      decodes in a crowded WSPR sub-band typically increases by 10 to
      15%.

 - New format for "EU VHF Contest" Tx2 and Tx3 messages

      When "EU VHF Contest" is selected, the Tx2 and Tx3 messages
      (those conveying signal report, serial number, and 6-character
      locator) now use hashcodes for both callsigns.  This change is
      NOT backward compatible with earlier versions of _WSJT-X_, so
      all users of EU VHF Contest messages should be sure to upgrade
      to versiion 2.2.0.

 - Accessibility

      Keyboard shortcuts have been added as an aid to accessibility:
      Alt+R sets Tx4 message to RR73, Ctrl+R sets it to RRR.

      As an aid for partial color-blindness, the "inverted goal posts"
      marking Rx frequency on the Wide Graph's frequency scale are now
      rendered in a darker shade of green.

 - Minor enhancements and bug fixes

      "Save None" now writes no .wav files to disk, even temporarily.

      An explicit entry for "WW Digi Contest" has been added to
      "Special operating activities" on the "Settings | Advanced" tab.

      Contest mode FT4 now always uses RR73 for the Tx4 message.

      The Status bar now displays the number of decodes found in the
      most recent Rx sequence.

Release candidate WSJT-X 2.2.0-rc1 will be available for beta-testing
for one month starting on May 10, 2020.  We currently plan a General
Availability (GA) release of WSJT-X 2.2.0 on June 1, 2020.

For those looking even farther ahead: We are well along in the
development of two new modes designed for the LF and MF bands.  One
mode is for WSPR-like activity and one for making 2-way QSOs.  Both
use Low-density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, 4-GFSK modulation, and
two-minute T/R sequences.  The QSO mode reaches threshold SNR
sensitivity around -31 dB on the AWGN channel, and the WSPR-like mode
better than -32 dB.


		   Release: WSJT-X 2.1.1

		       Release: WSJT-X 2.0
		        December 10, 2018
		     -----------------------

WSJT-X 2.0 is a major update that introduces new protocols for FT8 and
MSK144.  The new protocols become the world-wide standards on December
10, 2018.

WSJT-X 2.0 cannot communicate in these modes with other stations using
WSJT-X v1.9.1 or earlier.

Please help by urging everyone to upgrade no later than January 1, 2019.

New features since WSJT-X v1.9.1:

1. Compound and nonstandard callsigns are automatically recognized and
handled using new message formats.

2. The new FT8 protocol provides optimized message formats for North
American VHF contests, European VHF contests, ARRL Field Day, and ARRL
RTTY Roundup.  Similarly, the new MSK144 protocol provides optimized
message formats for North American VHF and European VHF contests.
Full support is provided for "/R" and "/P" calls in the relevant
contests.

3. The new protocols provide nearly equal (or better) sensitivity
compared to the old ones, and lower false decode rates.

4. New logging features are provided for contesting and for "Fox"
(DXpedition) mode.  Logging is optionally integrated with N1MM Logger+
and WriteLog.

5. Color highlighting of decoded messages provides worked-before
status for callsigns, grid locators, DXCC entities, continents, CQ
Zones, and ITU zones on a “by band” and “by mode” basis, and for
stations that have uploaded their logs to Logbook of the World (LoTW)
within a specified time interval.

6. The WSPR decoder now achieves decodes down to S/N = -31 dB.  For
the particular benefit of LF/MF users, an option "No own call decodes"
has been added.

7. The UDP messages sent to companion programs have been expanded and
improved.

Some details of changes since WSJT-X-rc5 include the following:

 - Initial load of ADIF log in background
 - Correct the UTC displayed in Fox/Contest log
 - Faster entry and correct scrolling for Fox/Contest log
 - Add contest exchanges and contest type to UDP logged QSO message
 - Fix a bug that suppressed decodes with negative DT.
 - AK and HI are DXCCs, not states, for RTTY Roundup
 - Fix improper truncation of some non-FT8 messages in ALL.TXT
 - Various minor bug fixes and code cleanup
 - Update the WSJT-X User Guide to v2.0 (more to come...)
 - Update cty.dat


		     Release: WSJT-X 2.0-rc5
		        November 26, 2018
		     -----------------------

Release Candidate 5 ("RC5") is stable, works well, and fixes the known
problems in RC4.  It is likely that the General Availability (GA)
release of WSJT-X 2.0 will be nearly identical to RC5.

Changes from WSJT-X 2.0-rc4 include the following:

 -  Make the "Auto Seq" checkbox sticky, again
 -  Remove the 5-minute mouse timer
 -  Correct the "worked before" logic for color highlighting
 -  Add "No own call decodes" checkbox in WSPR mode
 -  Display and log UTC (not local time) in contest operations
 -  Validate contest QSO details before allowing logging
 -  Force Aqua theme on macOS to avoid issues with Mojave dark theme
 -  Move Fox log Reset action to Fox log window context menu
 -  Improve layout of Working Frequencies and Station Information tables
 -  Allow deletes and editing in Fox and Contest log windows
 -  Add Tool Tips for Fox and Contest log windows
 -  Fix a bug causing false AP decodes in JT65 VHF+ operation
 -  Fix a bug that could switch unexpectedly from JT65 to JT9 mode

PLEASE NOTE: As far as WSJT-X 2.0 (RC4, RC5, and GA releases) are
concerned, signals using the old FT8 protocol are undecodable
interference.  This means that regenerated replicas cannot be
subtracted from received data, and consequently second- and third-pass
decodes may be impeded.  Full performance of the 77-bit decoder will
not be realized until most signals on a crowded band are using the
new FT8 protocol.

		     -----------------------
Changes from WSJT-X Version 2.0.0-rc1 include the following:

 - Corrected a flaw that encoded a message's first callsign as
   hexadecimal telemetry data if the call consisted only of letters
   A-F and digits 0-9.

 - Corrected program logic that failed to identify certain callsigns
   as "nonstandard".

 - Fixed a bug that color-highlighted bare CQ messages (no grid
   locator) as "New DXCC".

to post there.


		Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0
		       October 27, 2017
		-----------------------------

This is the full General Availability release of WSJT-X Version 1.8.0.

Changes from WSJT-X Version 1.8.0-rc3 are very minor:

 - Right-click on the Wide Graph now pops up a Context Menu.  Select
   the item *Set Rx & Tx Offset* to complete a one-handed setting of
   both red and green frequency markers.

 - Several clarifications and additions to Tool Tips and the User Guide.


We recommend that all users should upgrade to WSJT-X Version 1.8.0.

If you upgrade from v1.8.0-rc1 it may be necessary to do a one-time
reset of the default list of suggested operating frequencies.  Go to
*File->Settings->Frequencies*, right click on the table and select
*Reset*.


		Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0-rc3
		        October 16, 2017
		---------------------------------

Most (but not all) changes since Version 1.8.0-rc2 involve user
control of the increasingly popular FT8 mode.  The "RC3" release also
includes minor bug fixes and updates to the WSJT-X User Guide.  

The following list includes all of the more important changes:

- New optimization of GUI for simplex and split behavior in FT8 mode.

    1. Checkbox "Lock Tx Freq" on main window is relabeled "Hold Tx Freq".

    2. Double-clicking on decoded messages that do not contain your own
    call moves both Rx and Tx frequencies.  If the first callsign is
    your own call, only Rx freq moves.

    3. Double-clicking on decoded messages moves the Rx frequency.  If
    "Hold Tx Freq" is checked, Tx frequency is moved only if CTRL was
    held down.

    4. Clicking on the waterfall moves Rx and Tx frequencies as
    before: Rx only on a simple click, Tx only on SHIFT-click, and
    both on CTRL-click.  This happens even if "Hold Tx Freq" is
    checked. 

- Add a semi-automated "FreqCal" procedure: see *Solve for calibration
parameters* on the Tools menu.

- Improv auto-sequencing behavior: stop and on-frequency
transmission if a called station comes back to someone else.

- Improve S/N estimation in some situations involving QRM.

- Fix an initialization issue with user-modified application fonts.

- Fix an issue with Tx5 message generation with Type 2 compound calls.

- Enhance and improve the ADIF parser of logbook records.  Update
the band limits as per ADIF 3.0.6 specification.

- Increase the FT8 DT range to +/- 2.5 s.

- Do not allow window manager events to close the astronomical data
window.

- Add an "Erase" item to the context (right-click) menu for decoded
text.

- Extend UDP messages with an "off air" boolean field indicating that
the decode was derived from a .WAV file playback rather than an on air
reception.

- Extend reference applications to use the new off air decode message
field.

- Improve performance of FT8 decoder, especially for overlapping
signals.

- Allow specialized use of "x2 Tone Spacing" in FT8 and slow JT9
modes.

- Move "NA VHF Contest Mode" checkbox to main screen.  Query the
operator if d > 10000 km.

- Adjust UI to improve portability with font size changes and between
platforms.

- Extend UDP Reply message to support keyboard modifiers.  This allows
UDP servers to emulate keyboard modified double-clicks on decoded
messages, e.g. ALT+double-click for replying to a CQ or QRZ call
without changing ones Tx frequency offset.

- Update the cty.dat file (21st Sept 2017).

- Ensure that Fast Graph is properly initialized.

- Better handling of worked before and country name display.  Appended
text is added at a fixed column unless the message overlaps in which
case the appended information floats to the right.

- Restore printing of MSK144 decode quality information.

- Display Echo Graph automatically when Echo mode is started.

- Fix a bug that prevented double-click on a JT65 EME-style "OOO"
message from populating the Tx message boxes.

- Fixed behavior with double-click on 'CQ <AA-ZZ> <call> <grid>.'

- Update the "blank line" divider with band ID at 4*TRperiod/5.

- Fix cty.dat lookups that were not honouring exact match flags

- Add some further Copyright protections.

- Fix a bug involving "firstcall contains mycall" but not equal to mycall.

- Fix an issue with editing IARU regions in the working frequencies table.


		Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0-rc2
		        September 2, 2017
		---------------------------------

Implementation of FT8 and its auto-sequencing feature is now more
capable and more polished.  The decoder is faster and better: it now
includes signal subtraction, multi-pass decoding, and the use of
accumulated "a priori" information as a QSO progresses.  Sensitivity
extends downward as far as -24 dB in some circumstances.  Overlapping
signals 2 and 3 deep are frequently decoded at essentially the same
frequency.  On a crowded band we sometimes see more than 30 decodes in
a single 15-second interval, over a 2 kHz window.  The North American
VHF Contesting Mode has been extended to include both FT8 and MSK144
modes.

The "RC2" release also includes many minor bug fixes and an
extensively updated WSJT-X User Guide.

Depending on what code revision you upgrade from, it may be necessary 
to do a one-time reset of the default list of suggested operating 
frequencies.  Go to *File->Settings->Frequencies*, right click on 
the table and select *Reset*. 


		Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0
		-----------------------------

NEW FEATURES IN WSJT-X Version 1.8.0
------------------------------------

1.  New mode called FT8: sensitivity down to -20 dB on the AWGN
    channel; QSOs 4 times faster than JT65 or JT9; auto-sequencing
    includes an option to respond automatically to first decoded
    reply to your CQ.

2.  New mode for accurate Frequency Calibration of your radio.

3.  Improved performance of decoders for JT65, QRA64, and MSK144.
    MSK144 includes facilities for amplitide and phase equalization
    and an "SWL" mode for short-format messages.
    
4.  Options to minimize screen space used by Main and Wide Graph
    windows.
    
5.  Enhanced management scheme for table of operating frequencies, and
    a new set of default frequencies specific to the three IARU
    Regions.
    
6.  Improved CAT control for many rigs, including those controlled
    through Commander or OmniRig.
    
7.  New keyboard shortcuts to set "Tx even/1st" ON or OFF.

8.  A number of (mostly minor) bug fixes and tweaks to the user
    interface.  For example: new behavior for the audio level slider;
    correctly logged QSO start times in certain situations; correct
    control of FT-891/991 and some other radios via rigctld.

At the time of the v1.8.0-rc1 release the following tasks are yet to
be completed:

1.  Updates to WSJT-X User Guide.
2.  Sample files for FT8.
3.  Enhanced decoding using AP ("a priori") information.
4.  Signal subtraction and multi-pass decoding.
5.  Option to Auto-respond to the weakest responder to your CQ.


Installation packages for Windows, Linux, OS X, and Raspbian can be 
downloaded from the WSJT web site:
http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx.html

Please send bug reports to either wsjtgroup@yahoogroups.com or
wsjt-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.  Such reports should include a full
prescription of steps to reproduce the undesired behavior.  You must
be a subscriber to post to either of these lists.


		Brief Description of the FT8 Protocol
		-------------------------------------

WSJT-X Version 1.8.0 includes a new mode called FT8, developed by K9AN
and K1JT.  The mode name "FT8" stands for "Franke and Taylor, 8-FSK
modulation".  FT8 uses 15-second T/R sequences and provides 50% or
better decoding probability down to -20 dB on an AWGN channel.  An
auto-sequencing facility includes an option to respond automatically
to the first decoded reply to your CQ.  FT8 QSOs are 4 times faster
than those made with JT65 or JT9.  FT8 is an excellent mode for HF
DXing and for situations like multi-hop E_s on 6 meters, where deep
QSB may make fast and reliable completion of QSOs desirable.

Some important characteristics of FT8:

  - T/R sequence length: 15 s
  - Message length: 75 bits + 12-bit CRC
  - FEC code: LDPC(174,87)
  - Modulation: 8-FSK, tone spacing 6.25 Hz
  - Constant-envelope waveform
  - Occupied bandwidth: 50 Hz
  - Synchronization: 7x7 Costas arrays at start, middle, and end
  - Transmission duration: 79*1920/12000 = 12.64 s
  - Decoding threshold: -20 dB; several dB lower with AP decoding
  - Multi-decoder finds and decodes all FT8 signals in passband
  - Optional auto-sequencing and auto-reply to a CQ response
  - Operational behavior similar to JT9, JT65

We plan to implement signal subtraction, two-pass decoding, and use of
a priori (AP) information in the decoder.  These features are not yet
activated in v1.8.0.

We haven't yet finalized what the three extra bits in the message
payload will be used for.  Suggestions are welcome!
